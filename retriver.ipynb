In 1765, the Company, which till now had purely trading\\nfunctions obtained the ‘diwani’ (i.e., rights over revenue and civil\\njustice) of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.1 This started its career as a\\nterritorial power. In 1858, in the wake of the ‘sepoy mutiny’, the\\nBritish Crown assumed direct responsibility for the governance of\\nIndia. This rule continued until India was granted independence\\non August 15, 1947.\\nWith Independence came the need for a Constitution. Hence, a\\nConstituent Assembly was formed for this purpose in 1946 and on\\nJanuary 26, 1950, the Constitution came into being. However,\\nvarious features of the Indian Constitution and polity have their\\nroots in the British rule. There were certain events in the British\\nrule that laid down the legal framework for the organisation and\\nfunctioning of government and administration in British India.\\nThese events have greatly influenced our constitution and polity.\\nThey are explained here in a chronological order under two major\\nheadings :\\n1. The Company Rule (1773 – 1858)\\n2. The Crown Rule (1858 – 1947)'),\n",

It designated the Governor of Bengal as the ‘Governor-\\nGeneral of Bengal’ and created an Executive Council of four\\nmembers to assist him. The first such GovernorGeneral was\\nLord Warren Hastings.\\n2. It made the governors of Bombay and Madras presidencies\\nsubordinate to the governor-general of Bengal, unlike earlier,\\nwhen the three presidencies were independent of one\\nanother.\\n3.

It prohibited the servants of the Company from engaging in\\nany private trade or accepting presents or bribes from the\\n‘natives’.\\n5.

It excluded the revenue matters and the matters arising in\\nthe collection of revenue from the jurisdiction of the Supreme\\nCourt.\\n3.

It distinguished between the commercial and political\\nfunctions of the Company.\\n2. It allowed the Court of Directors to manage the commercial\\naffairs, but created a new body called Board of Control to\\nmanage the political affairs. Thus, it established a system of\\ndouble government.\\n3. It empowered the Board of Control to supervise and direct\\nall operations of the civil and military government or\\nrevenues of the British possessions in India.\\nThus, the act was significant for two reasons: first, the\\nCompany’s territories in India were for the first time called the\\n‘British possessions in India’; and second, the British Government\\nwas given the supreme control over Company’s affairs and its\\nadministration in India.'),\n",

It provided that the Company’s territories in India were\\nheld by it ‘in trust for His Majesty, His heirs and successors’.\\n4. The Charter Act of 1833 attempted to introduce a system of\\nopen competition for selection of civil servants and stated\\nthat the Indians should not be debarred from holding any\\nplace, office and employment under the Company.

In pursuance of this policy of\\nassociation, three acts were enacted by the British Parliament in\\n1861, 1892 and 1909. The Indian Councils Act of 1861 is an\\nimportant landmark in the constitutional and political history of\\nIndia.\\nThe features of this Act were as follows:\\n1. It made a beginning of the representative institutions by\\nassociating Indians with the law-making process. It, thus,\\nprovided that the Viceroy should nominate some Indians as\\nnon-official members of his expanded council. In 1862, Lord\\nCanning, the then Viceroy, nominated three Indians to his\\nlegislative council–the Raja of Benaras, the Maharaja of\\nPatiala and Sir Dinkar Rao.\\n2. It initiated the process of decentralisation by restoring the\\nlegislative powers to the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.\\nIt, thus, reversed the centralising tendency that started from\\nthe Regulating Act of 1773 and reached its climax under the\\nCharter Act of 1833. This policy of legislative devolution\\nresulted in the grant of almost complete internal autonomy to\\nthe provinces in 1937.\\n3. It also provided for the establishment of new legislative\\ncouncils for Bengal, North-Western Provinces and Punjab,\\nwhich were established in 1862, 1886 and 1897,\\nrespectively.\\n4. It empowered the Viceroy to make rules and orders for the\\nmore convenient transaction of business in the council. It\\nalso gave a recognition to the ‘portfolio’ system, introduced\\nby Lord Canning in 1859. Under this, a member of the\\nViceroy’s council was made in-charge of one or more\\ndepartments of the Government and was authorised to issue\\nfinal orders on behalf of the council on matters of his\\ndepartment(s).\\n5.

In 1938,\\nJawaharlal Nehru, on behalf the INC declared that ‘the\\nConstitution of free India must be framed, without outside\\ninterference, by a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of\\nadult franchise’.\\nThe demand was finally accepted in principle by the British\\nGovernment in what is known as the ‘August Offer’ of 1940. In\\n1942, Sir Stafford Cripps, a Member of the Cabinet, came to India\\nwith a draft proposal of the British Government on the framing of\\nan independent Constitution to be adopted after the World War II.\\nThe Cripps Proposals were rejected by the Muslim League, which\\nwanted India to be divided into two autonomous states with two\\nseparate Constituent Assemblies. Finally, a Cabinet Mission1 was\\nsent to India. While it rejected the idea of two Constituent\\nAssemblies, it put forth a scheme for the Constituent Assembly\\nwhich more or less satisfied the Muslim League.'),\n",

Out of 296 seats allotted\\nto the British India, 292 members were to be drawn from the\\neleven governors’ provinces2 and four from the four Chief\\nCommissioners’ provinces3 , one from each.\\n2.

The representatives of each community were to be elected\\nby members of that community in the provincial legislative\\nassembly and voting was to be by the method of\\nproportional representation by means of single transferable\\nvote.\\n5. The representatives of the princely states were to be\\nnominated by the heads of the princely states.\\nIt is, thus, clear that the Constituent Assembly was to be a\\npartly elected and partly nominated body. Moreover, the members\\nwere to be indirectly elected by the members of the provincial\\nassemblies, who themselves were elected on a limited franchise4 .\\nThe elections to the Constituent Assembly (for 296 seats\\nallotted to the British Indian Provinces) were held in July-August\\n1946. The Indian National Congress won 208 seats, the Muslim\\nLeague 73 seats and the small groups and independents got the\\nremaining 15 seats. However, the 93 seats allotted to the princely\\nstates were not filled as they decided to stay away from the\\nConstituent Assembly.'),\n",

Time Consuming: According to the critics, the Constituent\\nAssembly took unduly long time to make the Constitution.\\nThey stated that the framers of the American Constitution\\ntook only four months to complete their work8e. In this\\ncontext, Naziruddin Ahmed, a member of the Constituent\\nAssembly, coined a new name for the Drafting Committee to\\nshow his contempt for it. He called it a “Drifting\\nCommittee”.\\n4.

Lengthiest Written Constitution\\nConstitutions are classified into written, like the American\\nConstitution, or unwritten, like the British Constitution. The\\nConstitution of India is the lengthiest of all the written\\nConstitutions of the world. It is a very comprehensive, elaborate\\nand detailed document.\\nOriginally (1949), the Constitution contained a Preamble, 395\\nArticles (divided into 22 Parts) and 8 Schedules. Presently (2019),\\nit consists of a Preamble, about 470 Articles (divided into 25\\nParts) and 12 Schedules2. The various amendments carried out\\nsince 1951 have deleted about 20 Articles and one Part (VII) and\\nadded about 95 Articles, four Parts (IVA, IXA, IXB and XIVA) and\\nfour Schedules (9, 10, 11 and 12). No other Constitution in the\\nworld has so many Articles and Schedules3 .\\nFour factors have contributed to the elephantine size of our\\nConstitution. They are:\\n(a)Geographical factors, that is, the vastness of the country and\\nits diversity.\\n(b)Historical factors, e.g., the influence of the Government of\\nIndia Act of 1935, which was bulky.\\n(c)Single Constitution for both the Centre and the states4 .\\n(d)Dominance of legal luminaries in the Constituent Assembly.\\nThe Constitution contains not only the fundamental principles of\\ngovernance, but also detailed administrative provisions. Further,\\nthose matters which in other modern democratic countries have\\nbeen left to the ordinary legislation or established political\\nconventions have also been included in the constitutional\\ndocument itself in India.\\n2.

The\\nphilosophical part of the Constitution (the Fundamental Rights and\\nthe Directive Principles of State Policy) derive their inspiration\\nfrom the American and Irish Constitutions, respectively. The\\npolitical part of the Constitution (the principle of Cabinet\\nGovernment and the relations between the Executive and the\\nLegislature) have been largely drawn from the British Constitution7\\n.\\nThe other provisions of the Constitution have been drawn from\\nthe Constitutions of Canada, Australia, Germany, USSR (now\\nRussia), France, South Africa, Japan and so on8 .\\nThe most profound influence and material source of the\\nConstitution is the Government of India Act, 1935. The Federal\\nScheme, Judiciary, Governors, Emergency Powers, the Public\\nService Commissions and most of the administrative details are\\ndrawn from this Act. More than half of the provisions of\\nConstitution are identical to or bear a close resemblance to the\\nAct of 19359 .\\n3. Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility\\nConstitutions are also classified into rigid and flexible. A rigid\\nConstitution is one that requires a special procedure for its\\namendment, as for example, the American Constitution.

Article 1, on the other hand, describes India as a\\n‘Union of States’ which implies two things: one, Indian Federation\\nis not the result of an agreement by the states; and two, no state\\nhas the right to secede from the federation.\\nHence, the Indian Constitution has been variously described as\\n‘federal in form but, unitary in spirit’, ‘quasi-federal’ by K.C.\\nWheare, ‘bargaining federalism’ by Morris Jones, ‘co-operative\\nfederalism’ by Granville\\nAustin, ‘federation with a centralising tendency’ by Ivor\\nJennings and so on.\\n5.

The Constitution establishes the parliamentary\\nsystem not only at the Centre, but also in the states.\\nThe features of parliamentary government in India are:\\n(a) Presence of nominal and real executives;\\n(b)Majority party rule,\\n(c)Collective responsibility of the executive to the legislature,\\n(d)Membership of the ministers in the legislature,\\n(e)Leadership of the Prime Minister or the Chief Minister,\\n(f) Dissolution of the lower House (Lok Sabha or Assembly).\\nEven though the Indian parliamentary system is largely based\\non the British pattern, there are some fundamental differences\\nbetween the two.

Hence, the Constitution has\\nmade various provisions to ensure its independence–security of\\ntenure of the judges, fixed service conditions for the judges, all the\\nexpenses of the Supreme Court charged on the Consolidated\\nFund of India, prohibition on discussion on the conduct of judges\\nin the legislatures, ban on practice after retirement, power to\\npunish for its contempt vested in the Supreme Court, separation\\nof the judiciary from the executive, and so on.\\n8. Fundamental Rights\\nPart III of the Indian Constitution guarantees six11 fundamental\\nrights to all the citizens:\\n(a)Right to Equality (Articles 14–18);\\n(b)Right to Freedom (Articles 19–22);\\n(c)Right against Exploitation (Articles 23–24);\\n(d)Right to Freedom of Religion (Articles 25–28);\\n(e)Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29–30); and\\n(f) Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32).'),\n",

A Borrowed Constitution\\nThe critics opined that the Indian Constitution contains nothing\\nnew and original. They described it as a ‘borrowed Constitution’ or\\na ‘bag of borrowings’ or a ‘hotch-potch Constitution’ or a\\n‘patchwork’ of several documents of the world constitutions.\\nHowever, this criticism is unfair and illogical. This is because, the\\nframers of the Constitution made necessary modifications in the\\nfeatures borrowed from other constitutions for their suitability to\\nthe Indian conditions, at the same time avoiding their faults.\\nWhile answering the above criticism in the Constituent\\nAssembly, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the Chairman of the Drafting\\nCommittee, said : “One likes to ask whether there can be anything\\nnew in a Constitution framed at this hour in the history of the\\nworld. More than hundred years have rolled over when the first\\nwritten Constitution was drafted. It has been followed by many\\ncountries reducing their constitutions to writing. What the scope of\\na Constitution should be has long been settled. Similarly, what are\\nthe fundamentals of a Constitution are recognized all over the\\nworld. Given these facts, all Constitutions in their main provisions\\nmust look similar. The only new things, if there can be any, in a\\nConstitution framed so late in the day are the variations made to\\nremove the faults and to accommodate it to the needs of the\\ncountry. The charge of producing a blind copy of the Constitutions\\nof other countries is based, I am sure, on an inadequate study of\\nthe Constitution”.19\\n2. A Carbon Copy of the 1935 Act\\nThe critics said that the framers of the Constitution have included\\na large number of the provisions of the Government of India Act of\\n1935 into the Constitution of India. Hence, they called the\\nConstitution as a “Carbon Copy of the 1935 Act” or an “Amended\\nVersion of the 1935 Act”. For example, N. Srinivasan observed'),\n",

Similarly, Sir Ivor Jennings, a\\nBritish Constitutionalist, said that “the Constitution derives directly\\nfrom the Government of India Act of 1935 from which, in fact,\\nmany of its provisions are copied almost textually”.\\nFurther, P.R. Deshmukh, a member of the Constituent\\nAssembly, commented that “the Constitution is essentially the\\nGovernment of India Act of 1935 with only adult franchise added”.\\nThe same Dr. B.R. Ambedkar answered the above criticism in\\nthe Constituent Assembly in the following way : “As to the\\naccusation that the Draft Constitution has reproduced a good part\\nof the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, I make no\\napologies. There is nothing to be ashamed of in borrowing. It\\ninvolves no plagiarism. Nobody holds any patent rights in the\\nfundamental ideas of a Constitution. What I am sorry about is that\\nthe provisions taken from the Government of India Act, 1935,\\nrelate mostly to the details of administration”.20\\n3. Un-Indian or Anti-Indian\\nAccording to the critics, the Indian Constitution is ‘un-Indian’ or\\n‘anti-Indian’ because it does not reflect the political traditions and\\nthe spirit of India. They said that the foreign nature of the\\nConstitution makes it unsuitable to the Indian situation or\\nunworkable in India. In this context, K. Hanumanthaiya, a member\\nof the Constituent Assembly, commented : “We wanted the music\\nof Veena or Sitar, but here we have the music of an English band.\\nThat was because our Constitution-makers were educated that\\nway”.21 Similarly, Lokanath Misra, another member of the\\nConstituent Assembly, criticized the Constitution as a “slavish\\nimitation of the west, much more - a slavish surrender to the\\nwest”.22 Further, Lakshminarayan Sahu, also a member of the\\nConstituent Assembly, observed: “The ideals on which this draft\\nConstitution is framed have no manifest relation to the\\nfundamental spirit of India.

Elephantine Size\\nThe critics stated that the Indian Constitution is too bulky and too\\ndetailed and contains some unnecessary elements. Sir Ivor\\nJennings, a British Constitutionalist, observed that the provisions\\nborrowed were not always well-selected and that the constitution,\\ngenerally speaking, was too long and complicated.26\\nIn this context, H.V.

Paradise of the Lawyers\\nAccording to the critics, the Indian Constitution is too legalistic and\\nvery complicated. They opined that the legal language and\\nphraseology adopted in the constitution makes it a complex\\ndocument. The same Sir Ivor Jennings called it a “lawyer’s\\nparadise”.\\nIn this context, H.K. Maheswari, a member of the Constituent\\nAssembly, observed : “The draft tends to make people more\\nlitigious, more inclined to go to law courts, less truthful and less\\nlikely to follow the methods of truth and non-violence.

Sovereign\\nThe word ‘sovereign’ implies that India is neither a dependency\\nnor a dominion of any other nation, but an independent state2.\\nThere is no authority above it, and it is free to conduct its own\\naffairs (both internal and external).\\nThough in 1949, India declared the continuation of her full\\nmembership of the Commonwealth of Nations and accepted the\\nBritish Crown as the head of the Commonwealth, this extra-\\nconstitutional declaration does not affect India’s sovereignty in any\\nmanner3. Further, India’s membership of the United Nations\\nOrganisation (UNO) also in no way constitutes a limitation on her\\nsovereignty4 .\\nBeing a sovereign state, India can either acquire a foreign\\nterritory or cede a part of its territory in favour of a foreign state.\\n2. Socialist\\nEven before the term was added by the 42nd Amendment in\\n1976, the Constitution had a socialist content in the form of certain\\nDirective Principles of State Policy. In other words, what was\\nhitherto implicit in the Constitution has now been made explicit.\\nMoreover, the Congress party itself adopted a resolution5 to\\nestablish a ‘socialistic pattern of society’ in its Avadi session as\\nearly as in 1955 and took measures accordingly.\\nNotably, the Indian brand of socialism is a ‘democratic\\nsocialism’ and not a ‘communistic socialism’ (also known as ‘state\\nsocialism’) which involves the nationalisation of all means of\\nproduction and distribution and the abolition of private property.\\nDemocratic socialism, on the other hand, holds faith in a ‘mixed\\neconomy’ where both public and private sectors co-exist side by'),\n",

Secular\\nThe term ‘secular’ too was added by the 42nd Constitutional\\nAmendment Act of 1976. However, as the Supreme Court said in\\n1974, although the words ‘secular state’9 were not expressedly\\nmentioned in the Constitution, there can be no doubt that\\nConstitutionmakers wanted to establish such a state and\\naccordingly Articles 25 to 28 (guaranteeing the fundamental right\\nto freedom of religion) have been included in the constitution.\\nThe Indian Constitution embodies the positive concept of\\nsecularism ie, all religions in our country (irrespective of their\\nstrength) have the same status and support from the state10 .\\n4. Democratic\\nA democratic11 polity, as stipulated in the Preamble, is based on\\nthe doctrine of popular sovereignty, that is, possession of supreme\\npower by the people.\\nDemocracy is of two types–direct and indirect. In direct\\ndemocracy, the people exercise their supreme power directly as is\\nthe case in Switzerland. There are four devices of direct\\ndemocracy, namely, Referendum, Initiative, Recall and\\nPlebiscite12. In indirect democracy, on the other hand, the\\nrepresentatives elected by the people exercise the supreme\\npower and thus carry on the government and make the laws. This\\ntype of democracy, also known as representative democracy, is of\\ntwo kinds–parliamentary and presidential.\\nThe Indian Constitution provides for representative\\nparliamentary democracy under which the executive is\\nresponsible to the legislature for all its policies and actions.'),\n",

What does social democracy mean ? It\\nmeans a way of life which recognises liberty, equality and\\nfraternity. The principles of liberty, equality and fraternity are not to\\nbe treated as separate items in a trinity. They form a union of\\ntrinity in the sense that to divorce one from the other is to defeat\\nthe very purpose of democracy. Liberty cannot be divorced from\\nequality, equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor can liberty\\nand equality be divorced from fraternity. Without equality, liberty\\nwould produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality\\nwithout liberty, would kill individual initiative”.12a\\nIn the same context, the Supreme Court observed in 1997 that:\\n“The Constitution envisions to establish an egalitarian social order\\nrendering to every citizen social, economic and political justice in\\na social and economic democracy of the Bharat Republic”.\\n5. Republic\\nA democratic polity can be classified into two categories–\\nmonarchy and republic. In a monarchy, the head of the state\\n(usually king or queen) enjoys a hereditary position, that is, he\\ncomes into office through succession, e.g., Britain. In a republic,\\non the other hand, the head of the state is always elected directly\\nor indirectly for a fixed period, e.g., USA.\\nTherefore, the term ‘republic’ in our Preamble indicates that\\nIndia has an elected head called the president. He is elected\\nindirectly for a fixed period of five years.\\nA republic also means two more things: one, vesting of political\\nsovereignty in the people and not in a single individual like a king;'),\n",

The reason for inserting the\\nPreamble at the end was to ensure that it was in conformity with\\nthe Constitution as adopted by the Constituent Assembly.

With this, the\\nnumber of states of the Indian Union increased to 21 (Manipur\\n19th, Tripura 20th and Meghalaya 21st).

In 1974, Sikkim expressed its desire for greater\\nassociation with India. Accordingly, the 35th Constitutional\\nAmendment Act (1974) was enacted by the parliament. This\\namendment introduced a new class of statehood under the\\nconstitution by conferring on Sikkim the status of an ‘associate\\nstate’ of the Indian Union. For this purpose, a new Article 2-A and\\na new schedule (10th Schedule containing the terms and\\nconditions of association) were inserted in the Constitution. This\\nexperiment, however, did not last long as it could not fully satisfy\\nthe aspirations of the people of Sikkim. In a referendum held in\\n1975, they voted for the abolition of the institution of Chogyal and\\nSikkim becoming an integral part of India. Consequently, the 36th\\nConstitutional Amendment Act (1975) was enacted to make\\nSikkim a full-fledged state of the Indian Union (the 22nd state).\\nThis amendment amended the First and the Fourth Schedules to\\nthe Constitution and added a new Article 371-F to provide for\\ncertain special provisions with respect to the administration of\\nSikkim. It also repealed Article 2-A and the 10th Schedule that\\nwere added by the 35th Amendment Act of 1974.'),\n",

They are of two categories–friendly aliens or enemy aliens.\\nFriendly aliens are the subjects of those countries that have cordial\\nrelations with India. Enemy aliens, on the other hand, are the subjects of\\nthat country that is at war with India. They enjoy lesser rights than the\\nfriendly aliens, eg, they do not enjoy protection against arrest and\\ndetention (Article 22).\\nThe Constitution confers the following rights and privileges on the\\ncitizens of India (and denies the same to aliens):\\n1.Right against discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex\\nor place of birth (Article 15).\\n2.Right to equality of opportunity in the matter of public employment\\n(Article 16).\\n3.Right to freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association,\\nmovement, residence and profession (Article 19).\\n4.Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29 and 30).\\n5.Right to vote in elections to the Lok Sabha and state legislative\\nassembly.\\n6.Right to contest for the membership of the Parliament and the state\\nlegislature.\\n7.Eligibility to hold certain public offices, that is, President of India,\\nVice-President of India, judges of the Supreme Court and the high\\ncourts, Governor of states, Attorney General of India and Advocate\\nGeneral of states.\\nAlong with the above rights, the citizens also owe certain duties\\ntowards the Indian State, as for example, paying taxes, respecting the\\nnational flag and national anthem, defending the country and so on.\\nIn India both a citizen by birth as well as a naturalised citizen are\\neligible for the office of President while in USA, only a citizen by birth and\\nnot a naturalised citizen is eligible for the office of President.'),\n",

The other federal states like USA\\nand Switzerland, on the other hand, adopted the system of double\\ncitizenship.\\nIn USA, each person is not only a citizen of USA but also of the\\nparticular state to which he belongs.

Accordingly, the\\nParliament enacted the Public Employment (Requirement as to\\nResidence) Act, 1957, and thereby authorised the Government of\\nIndia to prescribe residential qualification only for appointment to\\nnon-Gazetted posts in Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur\\nand Tripura. As this Act expired in 1974, there is no such provision\\nfor any state except Andhra Pradesh5 and Telangana5a.\\n2.The Constitution (under Article 15) prohibits discrimination against\\nany citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth\\nand not on the ground of residence. This means that the state can\\nprovide special benefits or give preference to its residents in matters\\nthat do not come within the purview of the rights given by the\\nConstitution to the Indian citizens. For example, a state may offer\\nconcession in fees for education to its residents.\\n3.The freedom of movement and residence (under Article 19) is\\nsubjected to the protection of interests of any schedule tribe. In other\\nwords, the right of outsiders to enter, reside and settle in tribal areas\\nis restricted. Of course, this is done to protect the distinctive culture,'),\n",

In this regard, the framers of\\nthe Constitution derived inspiration from the Constitution of\\nUSA (i.e., Bill of Rights).\\nPart III of the Constitution is rightly described as the Magna Carta\\nof India.1 It contains a very long and comprehensive list of ‘justiciable’\\nFundamental Rights. In fact, the Fundamental Rights in our\\nConstitution are more elaborate than those found in the Constitution of\\nany other country in the world, including the USA.\\nThe Fundamental Rights are guaranteed by the Constitution to all\\npersons without any discrimination. They uphold the equality of all\\nindividuals, the dignity of the individual, the larger public interest and\\nunity of the nation.\\nThe Fundamental Rights are meant for promoting the ideal of\\npolitical democracy. They prevent the establishment of an\\nauthoritarian and despotic rule in the country, and protect the liberties\\nand freedoms of the people against the invasion by the State. They\\noperate as limitations on the tyranny of the executive and arbitrary\\nlaws of the legislature. In short, they aim at establishing ‘a government\\nof laws and not of men’.\\nThe Fundamental Rights are named so because they are\\nguaranteed and protected by the Constitution, which is the\\nfundamental law of the land. They are ‘fundamental’ also in the sense\\nthat they are most essential for the all-round development (material,\\nintellectual, moral and spiritual) of the individuals.\\nOriginally, the Constitution provided for seven Fundamental Rights\\nviz,\\n1.Right to equality (Articles 14–18)\\n2.Right to freedom (Articles 19–22)\\n3.Right against exploitation (Articles 23–24)\\n4.Right to freedom of religion (Articles 25–28)\\n5.Cultural and educational rights (Articles 29–30)\\n6.Right to property (Article 31)\\n7.Right to constitutional remedies (Article 32)'),\n",

The state can impose\\nreasonable restrictions on them. However, whether such\\nrestrictions are reasonable or not is to be decided by the courts.\\nThus, they strike a balance between the rights of the individual\\nand those of the society as a whole, between individual liberty\\nand social control.\\n3.All of them are available against the arbitrary action of the state.\\nHowever, some of them are also available against the action of\\nprivate individuals.\\n4.Some of them are negative in character, that is, place limitations\\non the authority of the State, while others are positive in nature,\\nconferring certain privileges on the persons.\\n5.They are justiciable, allowing persons to move the courts for\\ntheir enforcement, if and when they are violated.\\n6.They are defended and guaranteed by the Supreme Court.\\nHence, the aggrieved person can directly go to the Supreme\\nCourt, not necessarily by way of appeal against the judgement of\\nthe high courts.\\n7.They are not sacrosanct or permanent. The Parliament can\\ncurtail or repeal them but only by a constitutional amendment act\\nand not by an ordinary act. Moreover, this can be done without\\naffecting the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. (The\\namenability of fundamental rights is explained in detail in\\nChapter 11).\\n8.They can be suspended during the operation of a National\\nEmergency except the rights guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21.\\nFurther, the six rights guaranteed by Article 19 can be\\nsuspended only when emergency is declared on the grounds of\\nwar or external aggression (i.e., external emergency) and not on\\nthe ground of armed rebellion (i.e., internal emergency).

Equality before Law and Equal Protection of Laws\\nArticle 14 says that the State shall not deny to any person equality\\nbefore the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of\\nIndia. This provision confers rights on all persons whether citizens or\\nforeigners. Moreover, the word ‘person’ includes legal persons, viz,\\nstatutory corporations, companies, registered societies or any other\\ntype of legal person.\\nThe concept of ‘equality before law’ is of British origin while the\\nconcept of ‘equal protection of laws’ has been taken from the\\nAmerican Constitution. The first concept connotes: (a) the absence of\\nany special privileges in favour of any person, (b) the equal subjection\\nof all persons to the ordinary law of the land administered by ordinary\\nlaw courts, and (c) no person (whether rich or poor, high or low, official\\nor non-official) is above the law.\\nThe second concept, on the other hand, connotes: (a) the equality\\nof treatment under equal circumstances, both in the privileges\\nconferred and liabilities imposed by the laws, (b) the similar\\napplication of the same laws to all persons who are similarly situated,\\nand (c) the like should be treated alike without any discrimination.\\nThus, the former is a negative concept while the latter is a positive\\nconcept. However, both of them aim at establishing equality of legal\\nstatus, opportunity and justice.\\nThe Supreme Court held that where equals and unequals are\\ntreated differently, Article 14 does not apply. While Article 14 forbids\\nclass legislation, it permits reasonable classification of persons,\\nobjects and transactions by the law. But the classification should not\\nbe arbitrary, artificial or evasive. Rather, it should be based on an\\nintelligible differential and substantial distinction.\\nRule of Law The concept of ‘equality before law’ is an element of the\\nconcept of ‘Rule of Law’, propounded by A.V. Dicey, the British jurist.\\nHis concept has the following three elements or aspects:\\n(i)Absence of arbitrary power, that is, no man can be punished\\nexcept for a breach of law.\\n(ii)Equality before the law, that is, equal subjection of all citizens (rich\\nor poor, high or low, official or non-official) to the ordinary law of\\nthe land administered by the ordinary law courts3 .'),\n",

It refers to the social disabilities imposed on certain\\nclasses of persons by reason of their birth in certain castes. Hence, it\\ndoes not cover social boycott of a few individuals or their exclusion\\nfrom religious services, etc.\\nThe Supreme Court held that the right under Article 17 is available\\nagainst private individuals and it is the constitutional obligation of the\\nState to take necessary action to ensure that this right is not violated.\\n5.

Thus, the writ jurisdiction\\nof the Supreme Court, in this respect, is narrower than that of\\nhigh court.\\n2.The Supreme Court can issue writs against a person or\\ngovernment throughout the territory of India whereas a high\\ncourt can issue writs against a person residing or against a\\ngovernment or authority located within its territorial jurisdiction\\nonly or outside its territorial jurisdiction only if the cause of action\\narises within its territorial jurisdiction.15 Thus, the territorial\\njurisdiction of the Supreme Court for the purpose of issuing writs\\nis wider than that of a high court.\\n3.A remedy under Article 32 is in itself a Fundamental Right and\\nhence, the Supreme Court may not refuse to exercise its writ\\njurisdiction. On the other hand, a remedy under Article 226 is\\ndiscretionary and hence, a high court may refuse to exercise its\\nwrit jurisdiction. Article 32 does not merely confer power on the'),\n",

It is an\\norder issued by the court to a person who has detained another\\nperson, to produce the body of the latter before it. The court then\\nexamines the cause and legality of detention. It would set the detained\\nperson free, if the detention is found to be illegal. Thus, this writ is a\\nbulwark of individual liberty against arbitrary detention.\\nThe writ of habeas corpus can be issued against both public\\nauthorities as well as private individuals. The writ, on the other hand,\\nis not issued where the (a) detention is lawful, (b) the proceeding is for\\ncontempt of a legislature or a court, (c) detention is by a competent\\ncourt, and (d) detention is outside the jurisdiction of the court.\\nMandamus\\nIt literally means ‘we command’. It is a command issued by the court\\nto a public official asking him to perform his official duties that he has\\nfailed or refused to perform. It can also be issued against any public\\nbody, a corporation, an inferior court, a tribunal or government for the\\nsame purpose.\\nThe writ of mandamus cannot be issued (a) against a private\\nindividual or body; (b) to enforce departmental instruction that does\\nnot possess statutory force; (c) when the duty is discretionary and not\\nmandatory; (d) to enforce a contractual obligation; (e) against the\\npresident of India or the state governors; and (f) against the chief\\njustice of a high court acting in judicial capacity.\\nProhibition\\nLiterally, it means ‘to forbid’. It is issued by a higher court to a lower\\ncourt or tribunal to prevent the latter from exceeding its jurisdiction or\\nusurping a jurisdiction that it does not possess. Thus, unlike\\nmandamus that directs activity, the prohibition directs inactivity.'),\n",

Article 31, on the other hand,\\nguaranteed to every person, whether citizen or non-citizen, right\\nagainst deprivation of his property. It provided that no person shall be\\ndeprived of his property except by authority of law. It empowered the\\nState to acquire or requisition the property of a person on two\\nconditions: (a) it should be for public purpose, and ( b) it should\\nprovide for payment of compensation (amount) to the owner.\\nSince the commencement of the Constitution, the Fundamental\\nRight to Property has been the most controversial. It has caused\\nconfrontations between the Supreme Court and the Parliament. It has\\nled to a number of Constitutional amendments, that is, 1st, 4th, 7th,\\n25th, 39th, 40th and 42nd Amendments. Through these amendments,\\nArticles 31A, 31B and 31C have been added and modified from time\\nto time to nullify the effect of Supreme Court judgements and to\\nprotect certain laws from being challenged on the grounds of\\ncontravention of Fundamental Rights. Most of the litigation centred\\naround the obligation of the state to pay compensation for acquisition\\nor requisition of private property.\\nTherefore, the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 abolished the right to\\nproperty as a Fundamental Right by repealing Article 19(1) (f) and\\nArticle 31 from Part III. Instead, the Act inserted a new Article 300A in\\nPart XII under the heading ‘Right to Property’. It provides that no\\nperson shall be deprived of his property except by authority of law.\\nThus, the right to property still remains a legal right or a constitutional\\nright, though no longer a fundamental right. It is not a part of the basic\\nstructure of the Constitution.\\nThe right to property as a legal right (as distinct from the\\nFundamental Rights) has the following implications:\\n(a)It can be regulated ie, curtailed, abridged or modified without\\nconstitutional amend-ment by an ordinary law of the Parliament.\\n(b)It protects private property against executive action but not\\nagainst legislative action.\\n(c)In case of violation, the aggrieved person cannot directly move\\nthe Supreme Court under Article 32 (right to constitutional'),\n",

It\\nmakes no provision for important social and economic rights like right\\nto social security, right to work, right to employment, right to rest and\\nleisure and so on. These rights are made available to the citizens of\\nadvanced democratic countries. Also, the socialistic constitutions of\\nerstwhile USSR or China provided for such rights.\\n3. No Clarity\\nThey are stated in a vague, indefinite and ambiguous manner. The\\nvarious phrases and words used in the chapter like ‘public order’,\\n‘minorities’, ‘reasonable restriction’, ‘public interest’ and so on are not\\nclearly defined. The language used to describe them is very\\ncomplicated and beyond the comprehension of the common man.

The phrase ‘Directive Principles of State Policy’ denotes the\\nideals that the State should keep in mind while formulating\\npolicies and enacting laws. These are the constitutional\\ninstructions or recommendations to the State in legislative,\\nexecutive and administrative matters. According to Article\\n36, the term ‘State’ in Part IV has the same meaning as in\\nPart III dealing with Fundamental Rights. Therefore, it\\nincludes the legislative and executive organs of the central\\nand state governments, all local authorities and all other\\npublic authorities in the country.\\n2. The Directive Principles resemble the ‘Instrument of\\nInstructions’ enumerated in the Government of India Act of\\n1935. In the words of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, ‘the Directive\\nPrinciples are like the instrument of instructions, which were\\nissued to the Governor-General and to the Governors of the\\ncolonies of India by the British Government under the\\nGovernment of India Act of 1935. What is called Directive\\nPrinciples is merely another name for the instrument of\\ninstructions. The only difference is that they are instructions\\nto the legislature and the executive’.\\n3. The Directive Principles constitute a very comprehensive\\neconomic, social and political programme for a modern\\ndemocratic State. They aim at realising the high ideals of\\njustice, liberty, equality and fraternity as outlined in the\\nPreamble to the Constitution. They embody the concept of a\\n‘welfare state’ and not that of a ‘police state’, which existed\\nduring the colonial era3. In brief, they seek to establish\\neconomic and social democracy in the country.\\n4. The Directive Principles are non-justiciable in nature, that is,\\nthey are not legally enforceable by the courts for their\\nviolation. Therefore, the government (Central, state and\\nlocal) cannot be compelled to implement them.\\nNevertheless, the Constitution (Article 37) itself says that\\nthese principles are fundamental in the governance of the'),\n",

Consequently, the\\nFundamental Rights, which are justiciable in nature, are\\nincorporated in Part III and the Directive Principles, which are non-\\njusticiable in nature, are incorporated in Part IV of the\\nConstitution.\\nThough the Directive Principles are non-justiciable, the\\nConstitution (Article 37) makes it clear that ‘these principles are\\nfundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the\\nduty of the state to apply these principles in making laws’. Thus,\\nthey impose a moral obligation on the state authorities for their\\napplication, but the real force behind them is political, that is,\\npublic opinion. As observed by Alladi Krishna Swamy Ayyar, ‘no\\nministry responsible to the people can afford light-heartedly to\\nignore the provisions in Part IV of the Constitution’. Similarly, Dr.\\nB.R.

No Legal Force\\nThe Directives have been criticised mainly because of their non-\\njusticiable character. While K.T. Shah dubbed them as ‘pious\\nsuperfluities’ and compared them with ‘a cheque on a bank,\\npayable only when the resources of the bank permit’13 ,\\nNasiruddin contended that these principles are ‘no better than the\\nnew year’s resolutions, which are broken on the second of\\nJanuary’. Even as T.T. Krishnamachari described the Directives as\\n‘a veritable dustbin of sentiments’, K C Wheare called them as a\\n‘manifesto of aims and aspirations’ and opined that they serve as\\nmere ‘moral homily’, and Sir Ivor Jennings thought they are only\\nas ‘pious aspirations’.\\n2. Illogically Arranged\\nCritics opine that the Directives are not arranged in a logical\\nmanner based on a consistent philosophy. According to N\\nSrinivasan, ‘the Directives are neither properly classified nor\\nlogically arranged. The declaration mixes up relatively unimportant\\nissues with the most vital economic and social questions. It\\ncombines rather incongruously the modern with the old and\\nprovisions suggested by the reason and science with provisions\\nbased purely on sentiment and prejudice’14. Sir Ivor Jennings too\\npointed out that these principles have no consistent philosophy.\\n3. Conservative\\nAccording to Sir Ivor Jennings, the Directives are based on the\\npolitical philosophy of the 19th century England. He remarked:\\n‘The ghosts of Sydney Webb and Beatrice Webb stalk through the\\npages of the text. Part IV of the Constitution expresses Fabian'),\n",

The question whether they are suitable for the twenty-first\\ncentury cannot be answered; but it is quite probable that they will\\nbe entirely out moded.15\\n4. Constitutional Conflict\\nK Santhanam has pointed out that the Directives lead to a\\nconstitutional conflict (a) between the Centre and the states, (b)\\nbetween the President and the Prime Minister, and (c) between\\nthe governor and the chief minister. According to him, the Centre\\ncan give directions to the states with regard to the implementation\\nof these principles, and in case of non-compliance, can dismiss\\nthe state government. Similarly, when the Prime Minister gets a\\nbill (which violates the Directive Principles) passed by the\\nParliament, the president may reject the bill on the ground that\\nthese principles are fundamental to the governance of the country\\nand hence, the ministry has no right to ignore them. The same\\nconstitutional conflict may occur between the governor and the\\nchief minister at the state level.'),\n",

Setalvad, the former Attorney General of\\nIndia, the Directive Principles, although confer no legal rights and\\ncreate no legal remedies, are significant and useful in the\\nfollowing ways:\\n1. They are like an ‘Instrument of Instructions’ or general\\nrecommendations addressed to all authorities in the Indian\\nUnion. They remind them of the basic principles of the new\\nsocial and economic order, which the Constitution aims at\\nbuilding.\\n2.

They serve as a reminder to the citizens that while enjoying\\ntheir rights, they should also be conscious of duties they owe\\nto their country, their society and to their fellow citizens.\\n2. They serve as a warning against the antinational and\\nantisocial activities like burning the national flag, destroying\\npublic property and so on.\\n3. They serve as a source of inspiration for the citizens and\\npromote a sense of discipline and commitment among them.\\nThey create a feeling that the citizens are not mere\\nspectators but active participants in the realisation of\\nnational goals.\\n4. They help the courts in examining and determining the\\nconstitutional validity of a law. In 1992, the Supreme Court\\nruled that in determining the constitutionality of any law, if a\\ncourt finds that the law in question seeks to give effect to a\\nfundamental duty, it may consider such law to be\\n‘reasonable’ in relation to Article 14 (equality before law) or\\nArticle 19 (six freedoms) and thus save such law from\\nunconstitutionality.\\n5. They are enforceable by law. Hence, the Parliament can\\nprovide for the imposition of appropriate penalty or\\npunishment for failure to fulfil any of them.\\nH.R. Gokhale, the then Law Minister, gave the following reason\\nfor incorporating the fundamental duties in the Constitution after\\ntwenty-six years of its inauguration: ‘In post-independent India,\\nparticularly on the eve of emergency in June 1975, a section of\\nthe people showed no anxiety to fulfil their fundamental\\nobligations of respecting the established legal order ..... the\\nprovisions of chapter on fundamental duties would have a\\nsobering effect on these restless spirits who have had a host of\\nanti-national subversive and unconstitutional agitations in the\\npast’.'),\n",

The bill can be introduced either by a minister or by a private\\nmember and does not require prior permission of the\\npresident.\\n3. The bill must be passed in each House by a special majority,\\nthat is, a majority of the total membership of the House and\\na majority of two-thirds of the members of the House present\\nand voting.\\n4. Each House must pass the bill separately. In case of a\\ndisagreement between the two Houses, there is no provision\\nfor holding a joint sitting of the two Houses for the purpose of\\ndeliberation and passage of the bill.\\n5. If the bill seeks to amend the federal provisions of the\\nConstitution, it must also be ratified by the legislatures of half\\nof the states by a simple majority, that is, a majority of the\\nmembers of the House present and voting.\\n6. After duly passed by both the Houses of Parliament and\\nratified by the state legislatures, where necessary, the bill is\\npresented to the president for assent.\\n7. The president must give his assent to the bill. He can neither\\nwithhold his assent to the bill nor return the bill for\\nreconsideration of the Parliament.2\\n8.

There is no provision for a special body like Constitutional\\nConvention (as in USA) or Constitutional Assembly for\\namending the Constitution. The constituent power is vested\\nin the Parliament and only in few cases, in the state\\nlegislatures.\\n2. The power to initiate an amendment to the Constitution lies\\nwith the Parliament. Hence, unlike in USA4 , the state\\nlegislatures cannot initiate any bill or proposal for amending\\nthe Constitution except in one case, that is, passing a\\nresolution requesting the Parliament for the creation or\\nabolition of legislative councils in the states. Here also, the\\nParliament can either approve or disapprove such a\\nresolution or may not take any action on it.\\n3. Major part of the Constitution can be amended by the\\nParliament alone either by a special majority or by a simple\\nmajority. Only in few cases, the consent of the state\\nlegislatures is required and that too, only half of them, while\\nin USA, it is three-fourths of the states.\\n4. The Constitution does not prescribe the time frame within\\nwhich the state legislatures should ratify or reject an\\namendment submitted to them. Also, it is silent on the issue\\nwhether the states can withdraw their approval after\\naccording the same.\\n5. There is no provision for holding a joint sitting of both the\\nHouses of Parliament if there is a deadlock over the\\npassage of a constitutional amendment bill. On the other\\nhand, a provision for a joint sitting is made in the case of an\\nordinary bill.\\n6. The process of amendment is similar to that of a legislative\\nprocess. Except for the special majority, the constitutional\\namendment bills are to be passed by the Parliament in the\\nsame way as ordinary bills.'),\n",

The provisions relating to the amendment procedure are too\\nsketchy. Hence, they leave a wide scope for taking the\\nmatters to the judiciary.\\nDespite these defects, it cannot be denied that the process has\\nproved to be simple and easy and has succeeded in meeting the\\nchanged needs and conditions. The procedure is not so flexible as\\nto allow the ruling parties to change it according to their whims.\\nNor is it so rigid as to be incapable of adopting itself to the\\nchanging needs. It, as rightly said by K.C. Wheare, ‘strikes a good\\nbalance between flexibility and rigidity’5.

Wheare has admired the variety of amendment\\nprocedures contained in the Constitution of India.

The Supreme Court ruled that the\\npower of the Parliament to amend the Constitution under Article\\n368 also includes the power to amend Fundamental Rights. The\\nword ‘law’ in Article 13 includes only ordinary laws and not the\\nconstitutional amendment acts (constituent laws). Therefore, the\\nParliament can abridge or take away any of the Fundamental\\nRights by enacting a constitutional amendment act and such a law\\nwill not be void under Article 13.\\nBut in the Golak Nath case2 (1967), the Supreme Court\\nreversed its earlier stand. In that case, the constitutional validity of\\nthe Seventeenth Amendment Act (1964), which inserted certain\\nstate acts in the Ninth Schedule, was challenged. The Supreme\\nCourt ruled that the Fundamental Rights are given a\\n‘transcendental and immutable’ position and hence, the\\nParliament cannot abridge or take away any of these rights. A\\nconstitutional amendment act is also a law within the meaning of\\nArticle 13 and hence, would be void for violating any of the\\nFundamental Rights.\\nThe Parliament reacted to the Supreme Court’s judgement in\\nthe Golak Nath case (1967) by enacting the 24th Amendment Act\\n(1971). This Act amended Articles 13 and 368.\\nIt declared that the Parliament has the power to abridge or take\\naway any of the Fundamental Rights under Article 368 and such\\nan act will not be a law under the meaning of Article 13.'),\n",

It upheld the validity of the 24th Amendment Act (1971)\\nand stated that Parliament is empowered to abridge or take away\\nany of the Fundamental Rights. At the same time, it laid down a\\nnew doctrine of the ‘basic structure’ (or ‘basic features’) of the\\nConstitution. It ruled that the constituent power of Parliament\\nunder Article 368 does not enable it to alter the ‘basic structure’ of\\nthe Constitution. This means that the Parliament cannot abridge\\nor take away a Fundamental Right that forms a part of the ‘basic\\nstructure’ of the Constitution.\\nThe doctrine of basic structure of the constitution was\\nreaffirmed and applied by the Supreme Court in the Indira Nehru\\nGandhi case3a (1975). In this case, the Supreme Court invalidated\\na provision of the 39th Amendment Act (1975) which kept the\\nelection disputes involving the Prime Minister and the Speaker of\\nLok Sabha outside the jurisdiction of all courts. The court said that\\nthis provision was beyond the amending power of Parliament as it\\naffected the basic structure of the constitution.\\nAgain, the Parliament reacted to this judicially innovated\\ndoctrine of ‘basic structure’ by enacting the 42nd Amendment Act\\n(1976). This Act amended Article 368 and declared that there is\\nno limitation on the constituent power of Parliament and no\\namendment can be questioned in any court on any ground\\nincluding that of the contravention of any of the Fundamental\\nRights.\\nHowever, the Supreme Court in the Minerva Mills case4 (1980)\\ninvalidated this provision as it excluded judicial review which is a\\n‘basic feature’ of the Constitution. Applying the doctrine of ‘basic\\nstructure’ with respect to Article 368, the court held that:\\n“Since the Constitution had conferred a limited amending power\\non the Parliament, the Parliament cannot under the exercise of\\nthat limited power enlarge that very power into an absolute power.\\nIndeed, a limited amending power is one of the basic features of\\nthe Constitution and, therefore, the limitations on that power\\ncannot be destroyed.

Nominal and Real Executives\\nThe President is the nominal executive (de jure executive or titular\\nexecutive) while the Prime Minister is the real executive (de facto\\nexecutive). Thus, the President is head of the State, while the\\nPrime Minister is head of the government. Article 74 provides for a\\ncouncil of ministers headed by the Prime Minister to aid and\\nadvise the President in the exercise of his functions. The advice\\nso tendered is binding on the President1 .\\n2. Majority Party Rule\\nThe political party which secures majority seats in the Lok Sabha\\nforms the government. The leader of that party is appointed as the\\nPrime Minister by the President; other ministers are appointed by\\nthe President on the advice of the prime minister. However, when\\nno single party gets the majority, a coalition of parties may be\\ninvited by the President to form the government.\\n3. Collective Responsibility\\nThis is the bedrock principle of parliamentary government. The\\nministers are collectively responsible to the Parliament in general\\nand to the Lok Sabha in particular (Article 75). They act as a\\nteam, and swim and sink together. The principle of collective\\nresponsibility implies that the Lok Sabha can remove the ministry\\n(i.e., council of ministers headed by the prime minister) from office\\nby passing a vote of no confidence.\\n4. Political Homogeneity\\nUsually members of the council of ministers belong to the same\\npolitical party, and hence they share the same political ideology.

Harmony Between Legislature and Executive\\nThe greatest advantage of the parliamentary system is that it\\nensures harmonious relationship and cooperation between the\\nlegislative and executive organs of the government. The executive\\nis a part of the legislature and both are interdependent at work. As\\na result, there is less scope for disputes and conflicts between the\\ntwo organs.\\n2. Responsible Government\\nBy its very nature, the parliamentary system establishes a\\nresponsible government. The ministers are responsible to the\\nParliament for all their acts of omission and commission. The\\nParliament exercises control over the ministers through various\\ndevices like question hour, discussions, adjournment motion, no\\nconfidence motion, etc.\\n3. Prevents Despotism\\nUnder this system, the executive authority is vested in a group of\\nindividuals (council of ministers) and not in a single person. This\\ndispersal of authority checks the dictatorial tendencies of the\\nexecutive. Moreover, the executive is responsible to the\\nParliament and can be removed by a no-confidence motion.\\n4. Ready Alternative Government\\nIn case the ruling party loses its majority, the Head of the State\\ncan invite the opposition party to form the government. This\\nmeans an alternative government can be formed without fresh\\nelections. Hence, Dr. Jennings says, ‘the leader of the opposition\\nis the alternative prime minister’.\\n5.

Unstable Government\\nThe parliamentary system does not provide a stable government.\\nThere is no guarantee that a government can survive its tenure.\\nThe ministers depend on the mercy of the majority legislators for\\ntheir continuity and survival in office. A no-confidence motion or\\npolitical defection or evils of multiparty coalition can make the\\ngovernment unstable. The Government headed by Morarji Desai,\\nCharan Singh, V.P. Singh, Chandra Sekhar, Deva Gowda and I.K.\\nGujral are some such examples.\\n2. No Continuity of Policies\\nThe parliamentary system is not conductive for the formulation\\nand implementation of longterm policies. This is due to the\\nuncertainty of the tenure of the government. A change in the ruling\\nparty is usually followed by changes in the policies of the\\ngovernment. For example, the Janata Government headed by\\nMorarji Desai in 1977 reversed a large number of policies of the\\nprevious Congress Government. The same was repeated by the\\nCongress government after it came back to power in 1980.\\n3. Dictatorship of the Cabinet\\nWhen the ruling party enjoys absolute majority in the Parliament,\\nthe cabinet becomes autocratic and exercises nearly unlimited\\npowers. H.J. Laski says that the parliamentary system gives the\\nexecutive an opportunity for tyranny. Ramsay Muir, the former\\nBritish Prime Minister, also complained of the ‘dictatorship of the\\ncabinet’2. This phenomena was witnessed during the era of Indira\\nGandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.\\n4.

A\\nfederal government, on the other hand, is one in which powers are\\ndivided between the national government and the regional\\ngovernments by the Constitution itself and both operate in their\\nrespective jurisdictions independently. Britain, France, Japan,\\nChina, Italy, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Spain and so on have the\\nunitary model of government while the US, Switzerland, Australia,\\nCanada, Russia, Brazil, Argentina and so on have the federal\\nmodel of government.

Dual Polity\\nThe Constitution establishes a dual polity consisting the Union at\\nthe Centre and the states at the periphery. Each is endowed with\\nsovereign powers to be exercised in the field assigned to them\\nrespectively by the Constitution. The Union government deals with\\nthe matters of national importance like defence, foreign affairs,\\ncurrency, communication and so on. The state governments, on the\\nother hand, look after the matters of regional and local importance\\nlike public order, agriculture, health, local government and so on.\\n2. Written Constitution\\nThe Constitution is not only a written document but also the\\nlengthiest Constitution of the world. Originally, it contained a\\nPreamble, 395 Articles (divided into 22 Parts) and 8 Schedules.2 At\\npresent (2019), it consists of a Preamble, about 470 Articles\\n(divided into 25 Parts) and 12 Schedules.3 It specifies the structure,\\norganisation, powers and functions of both the Central and state\\ngovernments and prescribes the limits within which they must\\noperate. Thus, it avoids the misunderstandings and disagreements\\nbetween the two.\\n3. Division of Powers\\nThe Constitution divided the powers between the Centre and the\\nstates in terms of the Union List, State List and Concurrent List in\\nthe Seventh Schedule. The Union List consists of 98 subjects\\n(originally 97), the State List 59 subjects (originally 66) and the\\nConcurrent List 52 subjects (originally 47). Both the Centre and the\\nstates can make laws on the subjects of the concurrent list, but in\\ncase of a conflict, the Central law prevails. The residuary subjects\\n(ie, which are not mentioned in any of the three lists) are given to\\nthe Centre.'),\n",

Supremacy of the Constitution\\nThe Constitution is the supreme (or the highest) law of the land.\\nThe laws enacted by the Centre and the states must conform to its\\nprovisions. Otherwise, they can be declared invalid by the Supreme\\nCourt or the high courts through their power of judicial review. Thus,\\nthe organs of the government (legislative, executive and judicial) at\\nboth the levels must operate within the jurisdiction prescribed by the\\nConstitution.\\n5. Rigid Constitution\\nThe division of powers established by the Constitution as well as\\nthe supremacy of the Constitution can be maintained only if the\\nmethod of its amendment is rigid. Hence, the Constitution is rigid to\\nthe extent that those provisions which are concerned with the\\nfederal structure (i.e., Centre-state relations and judicial\\norganisation) can be amended only by the joint action of the Central\\nand state governments. Such provisions require for their\\namendment a special majority4 of the Parliament and also an\\napproval of half of the state legislatures.\\n6. Independent Judiciary\\nThe Constitution establishes an independent judiciary headed by\\nthe Supreme Court for two purposes: one, to protect the supremacy\\nof the Constitution by exercising the power of judicial review; and\\ntwo, to settle the disputes between the Centre and the states or\\nbetween the states. The Constitution contains various measures\\nlike security of tenure to judges, fixed service conditions and so on\\nto make the judiciary independent of the government.\\n7. Bicameralism\\nThe Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature consisting of\\nan Upper House (Rajya Sabha) and a Lower House (Lok Sabha).\\nThe Rajya Sabha represents the states of Indian Federation, while\\nthe Lok Sabha represents the people of India as a whole. The\\nRajya Sabha (even though a less powerful chamber) is required to\\nmaintain the federal equilibrium by protecting the interests of the\\nstates against the undue interference of the Centre.'),\n",

Strong Centre\\nThe division of powers is in favour of the Centre and highly\\ninequitable from the federal angle. Firstly, the Union List contains\\nmore subjects than the State List. Secondly, the more important\\nsubjects have been included in the Union List. Thirdly, the Centre\\nhas overriding authority over the Concurrent List. Finally, the\\nresiduary powers have also been left with the Centre, while in the\\nUS, they are vested in the states. Thus, the Constitution has made\\nthe Centre very strong.\\n2. States Not Indestructible\\nUnlike in other federations, the states in India have no right to\\nterritorial integrity. The Parliament can by unilateral action change\\nthe area, boundaries or name of any state. Moreover, it requires\\nonly a simple majority and not a special majority. Hence, the Indian\\nFederation is “an indestructible Union of destructible states”. The\\nAmerican Federation, on the other hand, is described as “an\\nindestructible Union of indestructible states”.\\n3. Single Constitution\\nUsually, in a federation, the states have the right to frame their own\\nConstitution separate from that of the Centre. In India, on the\\ncontrary, no such power is given to the states. The Constitution of\\nIndia embodies not only the Constitution of the Centre but also\\nthose of the states. Both the Centre and the states must operate\\nwithin this single-frame. The only exception in this regard was the\\ncase of Jammu and Kashmir which had its own (state)\\nConstitution.5\\n4.

Further, the power to initiate an\\namendment to the Constitution lies only with the Centre. In US, the\\nstates can also propose an amendment to the Constitution.\\n5. No Equality of State Representation\\nThe states are given representation in the Rajya Sabha on the\\nbasis of population. Hence, the membership varies from 1 to 31. In\\nUS, on the other hand, the principle of equality of representation of\\nstates in the Upper House is fully recognised. Thus, the American\\nSenate has 100 members, two from each state. This principle is\\nregarded as a safeguard for smaller states.\\n6. Emergency Provisions\\nThe Constitution stipulates three types of emergencies–national,\\nstate and financial. During an emergency, the Central government\\nbecomes all powerful and the states go into the total control of the\\nCentre. It converts the federal structure into a unitary one without a\\nformal amendment of the Constitution. This kind of transformation is\\nnot found in any other federation.\\n7. Single Citizenship\\nIn spite of a dual polity, the Constitution of India, like that of\\nCanada, adopted the system of single citizenship. There is only\\nIndian Citizenship and no separate state citizenship. All citizens\\nirrespective of the state in which they are born or reside enjoy the\\nsame rights all over the country.

But, in addition, there are\\nall-India services (IAS, IPS, and IFS) which are common to both the\\nCentre and the states.

Thus, KC Wheare\\ndescribed the Constitution of India as “quasi-federal”. He remarked\\nthat “Indian Union is a unitary state with subsidiary federal features\\nrather than a federal state with subsidiary unitary features.”6\\nAccording to K Santhanam, the two factors have been\\nresponsible for increasing the unitary bias (tendency of\\ncentralisation) of the Constitution. These are: (i) the dominance of\\nthe Centre in the financial sphere and the dependence of the states\\nupon the Central grants; and (ii) the emergence of a powerful\\nerstwhile planning commission which controlled the developmental\\nprocess in the states6a. He observed: “India has practically\\nfunctioned as a unitary state though the Union and the states have\\ntried to function formally and legally as a federation.”7\\nHowever, there are other political scientists who do not agree\\nwith the above descriptions. Thus, Paul Appleby8 characterises the\\nIndian system as “extremely federal”. Morris Jones9 termed it as a\\n“bargaining federalism”. Ivor Jennings10 has described it as a\\n“federation with a strong centralising tendency”. He observed that\\n“the Indian Constitution is mainly federal with unique safeguards for\\nenforcing national unity and growth”. Alexandrowicz11 stated that\\n“India is a case sui generis (i.e., unique in character). Granville\\nAustin12 called the Indian federalism as a “cooperative federalism”.\\nHe said that though the Constitution of India has created a strong\\nCentral government, it has not made the state governments weak\\nand has not reduced them to the level of administrative agencies for\\nthe execution of policies of the Central government.

It is clear that this view is not only\\nan exaggeration but is also founded on a misunderstanding of what\\nexactly the Constitution contrives to do. As to the relations between\\nthe Centre and the states, it is necessary to bear in mind the\\nfundamental principle on which it rests. The basic principle of\\nfederalism is that the legislative and executive authority is\\npartitioned between the Centre and the states not by any law to be\\nmade by the Centre but by the Constitution itself. This is what the\\nConstitution does. The states are in no way dependent upon the\\nCentre for their legislative or executive authority. The states and the\\nCentre are coequal in this matter. It is difficult to see how such a\\nConstitution can be called centralism. It is, therefore, wrong to say\\nthat the states have been placed under the Centre.

Further, the\\nConstitution provides for the parliamentary legislation in the state field\\nunder five extraordinary situations as well as the centre’s control over\\nstate legislation in certain cases.

Territorial Extent of Central and State Legislation\\nThe Constitution defines the territorial limits of the legislative powers\\nvested in the Centre and the states in the following way:\\n(i)The Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of the\\nterritory of India. The territory of India includes the states, the\\nunion territories, and any other area for the time being included in\\nthe territory of India.\\n(ii)A state legislature can make laws for the whole or any part of the\\nstate.

Thus,\\nthe laws of the Parliament are also applicable to the Indian\\ncitizens and their property in any part of the world.\\nHowever, the Constitution places certain restrictions on the plenary\\nterritorial jurisdiction of the Parliament. In other words, the laws of\\nParliament are not applicable in the following areas:\\n(i)The President can make regulations for the peace, progress and\\ngood government of the five Union Territories– the Andaman and\\nNicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman\\nand Diu and Ladakh.

In all federations, there is a Federal Civil Service and a State\\nCivil Service. The Indian federation, though a dual polity, will have a\\ndual service, but with one exception. It is recognised that in every\\ncountry there are certain posts in its administrative set up which might\\nbe called strategic from the point of view of maintaining the standard\\nof administration. There can be no doubt that the standard of\\nadministration depends upon the calibre of the civil servants who are\\nappointed to the strategic posts. The Constitution provides that without\\ndepriving the states of their rights to form their own civil services, there\\nshall be an all-India service, recruited on an allIndia basis with\\ncommon qualifications, with uniform scale of pay and members of\\nwhich alone could be appointed to those strategic posts throughout\\nthe Union”.8\\nPublic Service Commissions\\nIn the field of public service commissions, the Centre-state relations\\nare as follows:\\n(i)The Chairman and members of a state public service\\ncommission, though appointed by the governor of the state, can'),\n",

An emergency due to war, external aggression or armed\\nrebellion2 (Article 352). This is popularly known as ‘National\\nEmergency’.

The formula can\\nbe expressed as:\\nEach member of the electoral college is given only one ballot paper.\\nThe voter, while casting his vote, is required to indicate his\\npreferences by marking 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. against the names of\\ncandidates. This means that the voter can indicate as many\\npreferences as there are candidates in the fray.\\nIn the first phase, the first preference votes are counted. In case a\\ncandidate secures the required quota in this phase, he is declared\\nelected. Otherwise, the process of transfer of votes is set in motion.\\nThe ballots of the candidate securing the least number of first\\npreference votes are cancelled and his second preference votes are\\ntransferred to the first preference votes of other candidates. This\\nprocess continues till a candidate secures the required quota.\\nAll doubts and disputes in connection with election of the President\\nare inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court whose decision is\\nfinal. The election of a person as President cannot be challenged on\\nthe ground that the electoral college was incomplete (ie, existence of\\nany vacancy among the members of electoral college). If the election\\nof a person as President is declared void by the Supreme Court, acts\\ndone by him before the date of such declaration of the Supreme Court\\nare not invalidated and continue to remain in force.'),\n",

However, the Constitution makers chose\\nthe indirect election due to the following reasons3 :\\n1.The indirect election of the President is in harmony with the\\nparliamentary system of government envisaged in the\\nConstitution. Under this system, the President is only a nominal\\nexecutive and the real powers are vested in the council of\\nministers headed by the prime minister. It would have been\\nanomalous to have the President elected directly by the people\\nand not give him any real power.\\n2.The direct election of the President would have been very costly\\nand time- and energy-consuming due to the vast size of the\\nelectorate. This is unwarranted keeping in view that he is only a\\nsymbolic head.\\nSome members of the Constituent Assembly suggested that the\\nPresident should be elected by the members of the two Houses of\\nParliament alone. The makers of the Constitution did not prefer this as\\nthe Parliament, dominated by one political party, would have invariably\\nchosen a candidate from that party and such a President could not\\nrepresent the states of the Indian Union. The present system makes\\nthe President a representative of the Union and the states equally.\\nFurther, it was pointed out in the Constituent Assembly that the\\nexpression ‘proportional representation’ in the case of presidential\\nelection is a misnomer. Proportional representation takes place where\\ntwo or more seats are to be filled. In case of the President, the\\nvacancy is only one. It could better be called a preferential or\\nalternative vote system. Similarly, the expression ‘single transferable\\nvote’ was also objected on the ground that no voter has a single vote;\\nevery voter has plural votes.'),\n",

The\\nobject of conferring this power on the President is two-fold–(a) to\\nprevent hasty and ill-considered legislation by the Parliament; and (b)\\nto prevent a legislation which may be unconstitutional.\\nThe veto power enjoyed by the executive in modern states can be\\nclassified into the following four types:\\n1.Absolute veto, that is, withholding of assent to the bill passed by\\nthe legislature.\\n2.Qualified veto, which can be overridden by the legislature with a\\nhigher majority.\\n3.Suspensive veto, which can be overridden by the legislature with\\nan ordinary majority.\\n4.Pocket veto, that is, taking no action on the bill passed by the\\nlegislature.\\nOf the above four, the President of India is vested with three–\\nabsolute veto, suspensive veto and pocket veto. There is no qualified\\nveto in the case of Indian President; it is possessed by the American\\nPresident. The three vetos of the President of India are explained\\nbelow:\\nAbsolute Veto\\nIt refers to the power of the President to withhold his assent to a bill\\npassed by the Parliament. The bill then ends and does not become an\\nact.

These ordinances have\\nthe same force and effect as an act of Parliament, but are in the\\nnature of temporary laws.\\nThe ordinance-making power is the most important legislative\\npower of the President. It has been vested in him to deal with\\nunforeseen or urgent matters. But, the exercises of this power is\\nsubject to the following four limitations:\\n1. He can promulgate an ordinance only when both the Houses of\\nParliament are not in session or when either of the two Houses of\\nParliament is not in session. An ordinance can also be issued when\\nonly one House is in session because a law can be passed by both\\nthe Houses and not by one House alone. An ordinance made when\\nboth the Houses are in session is void. Thus, the power of the\\nPresident to legislate by ordinance is not a parallel power of\\nlegislation.\\n2. He can make an ordinance only when he is satisfied that the\\ncircumstances exist that render it necessary for him to take immediate\\naction. In Cooper case11 , (1970), the Supreme Court held that the\\nPresident’s satisfaction can be questioned in a court on the ground of\\nmalafide. This means that the decision of the President to issue an\\nordinance can be questioned in a court on the ground that the\\nPresident has prorogued one House or both Houses of Parliament\\ndeliberately with a view to promulgate an ordinance on a controversial\\nsubject, so as to bypass the parliamentary decision and thereby\\ncircumventing the authority of the Parliament. The 38th Constitutional\\nAmendment Act of 1975 made the President’s satisfaction final and\\nconclusive and beyond judicial review. But, this provision was deleted\\nby the 44th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1978. Thus, the\\nPresident’s satisfaction is justiciable on the ground of malafide.\\n3. His ordinance-making power is coextensive as regards all\\nmatters except duration, with the law-making powers of the\\nParliament. This has two implications:\\n(a)An ordinance can be issued only on those subjects on which the\\nParliament can make laws.\\n(b)An ordinance is subject to the same constitutional limitation as\\nan act of Parliament.

Under\\nthe presidential system of America, the President is the Chief head of\\nthe Executive and administration is vested in him. Under the Indian\\nConstitution, the President occupies the same position as the King\\nunder the English Constitution. He is the head of the State but not of\\nthe Executive. He represents the nation but does not rule the nation.\\nHe is the symbol of the nation. His place in administration is that of a\\nceremonial device or a seal by which the nation’s decisions are made\\nknown. He is generally bound by the advice of his ministers.

He is elected by\\nthe members of an electoral college consisting of the members of\\nboth Houses of Parliament.1 Thus, this electoral college is\\ndifferent from the electoral college for the election of the President\\nin the following two respects:\\n1. It consists of both elected and nominated members of the\\nParliament (in the case of president, only elected members).\\n2. It does not include the members of the state legislative\\nassemblies (in the case of President, the elected members\\nof the state legislative assemblies are included). Explaining\\nthe reason for this difference, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar observed:2\\n“The President is the head of the State and his power extends\\nboth to the administration by the Centre as well as to the states.\\nConsequently, it is necessary that in his election, not only\\nmembers of Parliament should play their part, but the members of\\nthe state legislatures should have a voice. But, when we come to\\nthe Vice-President, his normal functions are to preside over the\\ncouncil of states. It is only on a rare occasion, and that too for a\\ntemporary period, that he may be called upon to assume the\\nduties of the president. That being so, it does not seem necessary\\nthat the members of the state legislatures should also be invited to\\ntake part in the election of the Vice-President”.\\nBut, the manner of election is same in both the cases. Thus,\\nthe Vice-President’s election, like that of the President’s election,\\nis held in accordance with the system of proportional\\nrepresentation by means of the single transferable vote and the\\nvoting is by secret ballot.3\\nAll doubts and disputes in connection with election of the Vice-\\nPresident are inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court\\nwhose decision is final. The election of a person as Vice-President\\ncannot be challenged on the ground that the electoral college was\\nincomplete (i.e., existence of any vacancy among the members of\\nelectoral college).

Article 75 says\\nonly that the Prime Minister shall be appointed by the president.\\nHowever, this does not imply that the president is free to appoint\\nany one as the Prime Minister. In accordance with the conventions\\nof the parliamentary system of government, the President has to\\nappoint the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha as the\\nPrime Minister. But, when no party has a clear majority in the Lok\\nSabha, then the President may exercise his personal discretion in\\nthe selection and appointment of the Prime Minister. In such a\\nsituation, the President usually appoints the leader of the largest\\nparty or coalition in the Lok Sabha as the Prime Minister and asks\\nhim to seek a vote of confidence in the House within a month.\\nThis discretion was exercised by the President, for the first time in\\n1979, when Neelam Sanjiva Reddy (the then President) appointed\\nCharan Singh (the coalition leader) as the Prime Minister after the\\nfall of the Janata Party government headed by Morarji Desai.\\nThere is also one more situation when the president may have\\nto exercise his individual judgement in the selection and\\nappointment of the Prime Minister, that is, when the Prime\\nMinister in office dies suddenly and there is no obvious successor.\\nThis is what happened when Indira Gandhi was assassinated in\\n1984. The then President Zail Singh appointed Rajiv Gandhi as\\nthe Prime Minister by ignoring the precedent of appointing a\\ncaretaker Prime Minister.1 Later on, the Congress parliamentary\\nparty unanimously elected him as its leader. However, if, on the\\ndeath of an incumbent Prime Minister, the ruling party elects a\\nnew leader, the President has no choice but to appoint him as\\nPrime Minister.\\nIn 1980, the Delhi High Court held that the Constitution does\\nnot require that a person must prove his majority in the Lok Sabha\\nbefore he is appointed as the Prime Minister. The President may\\nfirst appoint him the Prime Minister and then ask him to prove his\\nmajority in the Lok Sabha within a reasonable period. For\\nexample, Charan Singh (1979), V.P.

In 1954, the Hindi names ‘Rajya Sabha’ and ‘Lok\\nSabha’ were adopted by the Council of States and the House of\\nPeople respectively. The Rajya Sabha is the Upper House\\n(Second Chamber or House of Elders) and the Lok Sabha is the\\nLower House (First Chamber or Popular House). The former\\nrepresents the states and union territories of the Indian Union,\\nwhile the latter represents the people of India as a whole.\\nThough the President of India is not a member of either House\\nof Parliament and does not sit in the Parliament to attend its\\nmeetings, he is an integral part of the Parliament. This is because\\na bill passed by both the Houses of Parliament cannot become\\nlaw without the President’s assent. He also performs certain\\nfunctions relating to the proceedings of the Parliament, for\\nexample, he summons and pro-rogues both the Houses, dissolves\\nthe Lok Sabha, addresses both the Houses, issues ordinances\\nwhen they are not in session, and so on.\\nIn this respect, the framers of the Indian Constitution relied on\\nthe British pattern rather than the American pattern. In Britain, the\\nParliament consists of the Crown (King or Queen), the House of\\nLords (Upper House) and the House of Commons (Lower House).\\nBy contrast, the American president is not an integral part of the\\nlegislature. In USA, the legislature, which is known as Congress,\\nconsists of the Senate (Upper House) and the House of\\nRepresentatives (Lower House).\\nThe parliamentary form of government emphasises on the\\ninterdependence between the legislative and executive organs.\\nHence, we have the ‘President-in-Parliament’ like the ‘Crown-in-\\nParliament’ in Britain. The presidential form of government, on the\\nother hand, lays stress on the separation of legislative and\\nexecutive organs. Hence, the American president is not regarded\\nas a constituent part of the Congress.'),\n",

The leader of the largest Opposition party having not\\nless than one-tenth seats of the total strength of the House is\\nrecognised as the leader of the Opposition in that House. In a\\nparliamentary system of government, the leader of the opposition\\nhas a significant role to play. His main functions are to provide a\\nconstructive criticism of the policies of the government and to\\nprovide an alternative government. Therefore, the leader of\\nOpposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha were accorded\\nstatutory recognition in 1977. They are also entitled to the salary,\\nallowances and other facilities equivalent to that of a cabinet\\nminister. It was in 1969 that an official leader of the opposition was\\nrecognised for the first time. The same functionary in USA is\\nknown as the ‘minority leader’.\\nThe British political system has an unique institution called the\\n‘Shadow Cabinet’. It is formed by the Opposition party to balance\\nthe ruling cabinet and to prepare its members for future ministerial\\noffices. In this shadow cabinet, almost every member in the ruling\\ncabinet is ‘shadowed’ by a corresponding member in the'),\n",

Overall, the budget\\ncontains the following:\\n1. Estimates of revenue and capital receipts;\\n2. Ways and means to raise the revenue;\\n3. Estimates of expenditure;\\n4. Details of the actual receipts and expenditure of the closing\\nfinancial year and the reasons for any deficit or surplus in\\nthat year; and\\n5. Economic and financial policy of the coming year, that is,\\ntaxation proposals, prospects of revenue, spending\\nprogramme and introduction of new schemes/projects.\\nTill 2017, the Government of India had two budgets, namely,\\nthe Railway Budget and the General Budget. While the former\\nconsisted of the estimates of receipts and expenditures of only the\\nMinistry of Railways, the latter consisted of the estimates of\\nreceipts and expenditure of all the ministries of the Government of\\nIndia (except the railways).\\nThe Railway Budget was separated from the General Budget in\\n1924 on the recommendations of the Acworth Committee Report\\n(1921). The reasons or objectives of this separation were as\\nfollows:\\n1. To introduce flexibility in railway finance.\\n2. To facilitate a business approach to the railway policy.\\n3. To secure stability of the general revenues by providing an\\nassured annual contribution from railway revenues.'),\n",

The enactment of the budget by the\\nParliament legalises the receipts and expenditure of the\\ngovernment for the ensuing financial year.\\nThe Parliament also scrutinises government spending and\\nfinancial performance with the help of its financial committees.\\nThese include public accounts committee, estimates committee\\nand committee on public undertakings. They bring out the cases\\nof illegal, irregular, unauthorised, improper usage and wastage\\nand extravagance in public expenditure.\\nTherefore, the parliamentary control over the Executive in\\nfinancial matters operates in two stages:\\n(a)budgetary control, that is, control before the appropriation of\\ngrants through the enactment of the budget; and\\n(b)post-budgetary control, that is, control after the appropriation\\nof grants through the three financial committees.\\nThe budget is based on the principle of annuity, that is, the\\nParliament grants money to the government for one financial year.\\nIf the granted money is not spent by the end of the financial year,\\nthen the balance expires and returns to the Consolidated Fund of\\nIndia. This practice is known as the ‘rule of lapse’. It facilitates\\neffective financial control by the Parliament as no reserve funds\\ncan be built without its authorisation. However, the observance of\\nthis rule leads to heavy rush of expenditure towards the close of\\nthe financial year. This is popularly called as ‘March Rush’.\\n4.

The British Courts have to apply the\\nParliamentary laws to specific cases, without examining their\\nconstitutionality, legality or reasonableness.\\n4. Fundamental Rights\\nThe authority of the Parliament is also restricted by the\\nincorporation of a code of justiciable fundamental rights under\\nPart III of the Constitution. Article 13 prohibits the State from\\nmaking a law that either takes away totally or abrogates in part a\\nfundamental right. Hence, a Parliamentary law that contravenes\\nthe fundamental rights shall be void. In Britain, on the other hand,\\nthere is no codification of justiciable fundamental rights in the\\nConstitution. The British Parliament has also not made any law\\nthat lays down the fundamental rights of the citizens. However, it'),\n",

The functions of the Parliament are\\nvaried, complex and voluminous. Moreover, it has neither the\\nadequate time nor necessary expertise to make a detailed\\nscrutiny of all legislative measures and other matters. Therefore, it\\nis assisted by a number of committees in the discharge of its\\nduties.\\nThe Constitution of India makes a mention of these committees\\nat different places, but without making any specific provisions\\nregarding their composition, tenure, functions, etc. All these\\nmatters are dealt by the rules of two Houses. Accordingly, a\\nparliamentary committee means a committee that:\\n1. Is appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the\\nSpeaker / Chairman1\\n2. Works under the direction of the Speaker / Chairman\\n3. Presents its report to the House or to the Speaker /\\nChairman\\n4.

Kaul and S.L. Shakdher have nicely explained the rationale\\nof the Indian Parliamentary Group (IPG) in the following way:\\nThe establishment and development of relations among\\nparliaments constitutes part of the regular activities of national\\nparliaments. Although promotion of inter-parliamentary relations\\nhas for many years been a significant part of the work of\\nparliamentarians, recently it has received a new thrust due to the\\nincreased inter-dependence of nations in a global environment. It\\nis imperative that parliamentarians will join hands to safeguard\\ndemocracy and work in synergy to confront the challenges before\\nthe world and convert them into opportunities to facilitate peace\\nand prosperity in their countries as well as globally.\\nParliamentarians from different parts of the world, therefore, have\\na forum where they can meet to discuss and find out solutions to\\ntheir common problems. It is here that some sort of cross-\\nfertilisation of ideas can take place not only between the older and\\nthe younger parliaments, but also between parliamentarians\\nworking under different parliamentary systems. These problems\\nare no doubt discussed in inter-governmental conferences;\\nhowever, those discussions are not so frank and free as they can\\nbe at a conclave of legislators.1\\nInter-parliamentary relations thus assume great importance\\ntoday when the whole world is beset with many pressing\\nproblems. The problems that are faced by one parliament today\\nmay confront another tomorrow. It is, therefore, essential that a\\nlink should exist between various parliaments of the world. This\\nlink is maintained by India through the exchange of delegations,\\ngoodwill missions, correspondence, documents, etc. with foreign\\nparliaments through the machinery of the IPG that acts both as\\nthe National Group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and'),\n",

Hence, it ruled that the advice tendered by the Chief\\nJustice of India is binding on the President in the matters of\\nappointment of the judges of the Supreme Court.

Some of\\nthe observations made by it, in this regard, are given below:\\n“In India it is the Constitution that is supreme and that a statute\\nlaw to be valid, must be in conformity with the constitutional\\nrequirements and it is for the judiciary to decide whether any\\nenactment is constitutional or not”.2\\n“Our constitution contains express provisions for judicial review\\nof legislation as to its conformity with the constitution. This is\\nespecially true as regards the Fundamental Rights, to which the\\ncourt has been assigned the role of sentinel on the qui vive”.3\\n“As long as some Fundamental Rights exist and are a part of\\nthe Constitution, the power of judicial review has also to be\\nexercised with a view to see that the guarantees afforded by these\\nRights are not contravened”.4\\n“The Constitution is supreme lex, the permanent law of the\\nland, and there is no branch of government above it. Every organ\\nof government, be it the executive or the legislature of the\\njudiciary, derives its authority from the Constitution and it has to\\nact within the limits of its authority. No one however highly placed\\nand no authority howsoever lofty, can claim that it shall be the sole\\njudge of the extent of its power under the Constitution or whether\\nits action is within the confines of such power laid down by the\\nconstitution. This Court is the ultimate interpreter of the\\nConstitution and to this Court is assigned the delicate task of\\ndetermining what is the power conferred on each branch of\\ngovernment, whether it is limited, and if so, what are the limits and\\nwhether any action of that branch transgresses such limits”.5\\n“It is the function of the Judges, may their duty, to pronounce\\nupon the validity of laws.

But, there is a difference between them. The\\nfollowing points bring out this difference:\\n1. Since about the mid-20th century, a version of judicial review\\nhas acquired the nick-name of judicial activism, especially in\\nthe USA. In India, the participants in the debate mix up\\njudicial activism with judicial review. The former is that form\\nof latter in which judges participate in law-making policies,\\ni.e., not only they uphold or invalidate laws in terms of\\nconstitutional provisions, but also exercise their policy\\npreferences in doing so.3d\\n2. The concept of judicial activism is inherent in judicial review,\\nwhich empowers the court to uphold the constitution and\\ndeclare the laws and action inconsistent with the constitution\\nas void. Judicial activism is necessary for ensuring proper\\ndischarge of duties by other organs.3e\\n3. The term “judicial activism” came into currency some time in\\nthe twentieth century to describe the act of judicial legislation\\ni.e., judges making positive law. However, there is no\\nstandard definition of the term “judicial activism”. As a whole\\nit can be said that judicial activism stresses the importance\\nof judicial review and a powerful judiciary in the protection\\nand promotion of certain core rights.3f\\n4. The expanded concept of locus standi in connection with\\nPIL, by judicial interpretation from time-to-time, has\\nexpanded the jurisdictional limits of the courts exercising\\njudicial review. This expanded role has been given the title of\\n“judicial activism” by those who are critical of this expanded\\nrole of the judiciary.3g\\n5. Judicial activism, as regards constitutional cases, falls under\\nthe rubric of what is commonly called judicial review, and at\\nthe broadest level, it is any occasion where a court\\nintervenes and strikes down a piece of duly enacted\\nlegislation.3h'),\n",

JUDICIAL RESTRAINT\\nMeaning of Judicial Restraint\\nJudicial activism and judicial restraint are the two alternative\\njudicial philosophies in the United States. Those who subscribe to\\njudicial restraint contend that the role of judges should be\\nscrupulously limited; their job is merely to say what the law is,\\nleaving the business of lawmaking where it properly belongs, that\\nis, with the legislators and the executives. Under no\\ncircumstances, moreover, should judges allow their personal\\npolitical values and policy agendas to colour their judicial opinions.\\nThis view holds that the ‘original intent’ of the authors of the\\nconstitution and its amendments is knowable, and must guide the\\ncourts.8\\nAssumptions of Judicial Restraint\\nIn the USA, the doctrine of judicial restraint is based on the\\nfollowing six assumptions9 :\\n1. The Court is basically undemocratic because it is non-\\nelective and presumably non-responsive to the popular will.\\nBecause of its alleged oligarchic composition the court\\nshould defer wherever possible to the ‘more’ democratic\\nbranches of government.\\n2. The questionable origins of the great power of judicial\\nreview, a power not specifically granted by the Constitution.\\n3. The doctrine of separation of powers.\\n4. The concept of federalism, dividing powers between the\\nnation and the states requires of the Court deference toward\\nthe action of state governments and officials.\\n5. The non-ideological but pragmatic assumption that since the\\nCourt is dependent on the Congress for its jurisdiction and\\nresources, and dependent on public acceptance for its\\neffectiveness, it ought not to overstep its boundaries without\\nconsideration of the risks involved.'),\n",

In this context, the concerned\\nBench of the court made the following observations10 :\\n1. The Bench said, “We are repeatedly coming across cases\\nwhere judges are unjustifiably trying to perform executive or\\nlegislative functions. This is clearly unconstitutional. In the\\nname of judicial activism, judges cannot cross their limits\\nand try to take over functions which belong to another organ\\nof the state”.\\n2. The Bench said, “Judges must know their limits and must\\nnot try to run the government. They must have modesty and\\nhumility, and not behave like emperors.”\\n3. Quoting from the book ‘The Spirit of Laws’ by Montesquieu\\non the consequences of not maintaining separation of\\npowers among the three organs, the Bench said the French\\npolitical philosopher’s “warning is particularly apt and timely\\nfor the Indian judiciary today, since very often it is rightly\\ncriticised for ‘overreach’ and encroachment on the domain of\\nthe other two organs.”\\n4. Judicial activism must not become judicial adventurism, the\\nBench warned the courts Adjudication must be done within\\nthe system of historically validated restraints and conscious\\nminimisation of judges’ preferences.'),\n",

The Bench said, “The justification often given for judicial\\nencroachment on the domain of the executive or the\\nlegislature is that the other two organs are not doing their\\njobs properly. Even assuming this is so, the same\\nallegations can be made against the judiciary too because\\nthere are cases pending in courts for half-a-century.”\\n7. If the legislature or the executive was not functioning\\nproperly, it was for the people to correct the defects by\\nexercising their franchise properly in the next elections and\\nvoting for candidates who would fulfil their expectations or by\\nother lawful methods, e.g., peaceful demonstrations.\\n8. “The remedy is not in the judiciary taking over the legislative\\nor the executive functions, because that will not only violate\\nthe delicate balance of power enshrined in the Constitution\\nbut also (because) the judiciary has neither the expertise nor\\nthe resources to perform these functions.”\\n9. The Bench said: “Judicial restraint is consistent with and\\ncomplementary to the balance of power among the three\\nindependent branches of the state. It accomplishes this in\\ntwo ways: first, judicial restraint not only recognises the\\nequality of the other two branches with the judiciary, it also\\nfosters that equality by minimising inter-branch interference\\nby the judiciary. Second, judicial restraint tends to protect the\\nindependence of the judiciary. When courts encroach on the\\nlegislative or administrative fields almost inevitably voters,\\nlegislators, and other elected officials will conclude that the\\nactivities of judges should be closely monitored.\\nNOTES AND REFERENCES\\n1.

Such groups and\\ninterests include the poor, environmentalists, consumers, racial\\nand ethnic minorities, and others.1\\nIn India, the PIL is a product of the judicial activism role of the\\nSupreme Court.

According to this rule, only that\\nperson whose rights are infringed alone can move the court for\\nthe remedies, whereas, the PIL is an exception to this traditional\\nrule. Under the PIL, any public-spirited citizen or a social\\norganisation can move the court for the enforcement of the rights\\nof any person or group of persons who because of their poverty or\\nignorance or socially or economically disadvantaged position are\\nthemselves unable to approach the court for the remedies. Thus,\\nin a PIL, any member of the public having ‘sufficient interest’ can\\napproach the court for enforcing the rights of other persons and\\nredressal of a common grievance.\\nThe Supreme Court has defined the PIL as “a legal action\\ninitiated in a court of law for the enforcement of public interest or\\ngeneral interest in which the public or a class of the community\\nhave pecuniary interest or some interest by which their legal rights\\nor liabilities are affected.”2\\nPIL is absolutely necessary for maintaining the rule of law,\\nfurthering the cause of justice and accelerating the pace of\\nrealisation of the constitutional objectives. In other words, the real\\npurposes of PIL are:\\n(i) vindication of the rule of law,\\n(ii)facilitating effective access to justice to the socially and\\neconomically weaker sections of the society, and\\n(iii)meaningful realisation of the fundamental rights.'),\n",

PIL is a strategic arm of the legal aid movement and is\\nintended to bring justice within the reach of the poor masses,\\nwho constitute the low visibility area of humanity.\\n2. PIL is a totally different kind of litigation from the ordinary\\ntraditional litigation which is essentially of an adversary\\ncharacter where there is a dispute between two litigating\\nparties, one making claims seeking relief against the other\\nand that other opposing such claim or resisting such relief.\\n3. PIL is brought before the Court not for the purpose of\\nenforcing the right of one individual against another as\\nhappens in the case of ordinary litigation, but it is intended to\\npromote and vindicate public interest.\\n4. PIL demands that violations of constitutional and legal rights\\nof large numbers of people who are poor, ignorant or in a\\nsocially or economically disadvantaged position should not\\ngo unnoticed and unredressed.\\n5. PIL is essentially a co-operative effort on the part of the\\npetitioner, the State or Public Authority, and the Court to\\nsecure observance of the constitutional or legal rights,\\nbenefits and privileges conferred upon the vulnerable\\nsections of the community and to reach social justice to\\nthem.\\n6. In PIL, litigation is undertaken for the purpose of redressing\\npublic injury, enforcing public duty, protecting social,\\ncollective, diffused rights and interests or vindicating public\\ninterest.\\n7. In PIL, the role held by the Court is more assertive than in\\ntraditional actions; it is creative rather than passive and it\\nassumes a more positive attitude in determining acts.\\n8. Though in PIL court enjoys a degree of flexibility unknown to\\nthe trial of traditional private law litigations, whatever the\\nprocedure adopted by the court it must be procedure known\\nto judicial tenets and characteristics of a judicial proceeding.'),\n",

The common rule of locus standi is relaxed so as to enable\\nthe court to look into the grievances complained on behalf of\\nthe poor, deprived, illiterate and the disabled who cannot\\nvindicate the legal wrong or legal injury caused to them for\\nviolation of any constitutional or legal right.\\n5. When the Court is prima facie satisfied about violation of any\\nconstitutional right of a group of people belonging to the\\ndisadvantaged category, it may not allow the State or the\\nGovernment from raising the question as to the\\nmaintainability of the petition.\\n6.

It was essentially meant to protect\\nbasic human rights of the weak and the disadvantaged and was a\\nprocedure which was innovated where a public-spirited person\\nfiles a petition in effect on behalf of such persons who on account\\nof poverty, helplessness or economic and social disabilities could\\nnot approach the court for relief. There have been, in recent times\\nincreasingly instances of abuse of PIL. Therefore, there is a need\\nto re-emphasise the parameters within which PIL can be resorted\\nto by a petitioner and entertained by the court.”5\\nTherefore, the Supreme Court laid down the following\\nguidelines for checking the misuse of the PIL6 :\\n1. The court must encourage genuine and bona fide PIL and\\neffectively discourage and curb the PIL field for extraneous\\nconsiderations.\\n2. Instead of every individual Judge devising his own\\nprocedure for dealing with PIL, it would be appropriate for\\neach High Court to properly formulate rules for encouraging\\nthe genuine PIL filed and discouraging PIL filed with oblique\\nmotives.\\n3. The Court should prima facie verify the credentials of the\\npetitioner before entertaining the PIL.\\n4. The Court shall be prima facie satisfied regarding the\\ncorrectness of the contents of petition before entertaining the\\nPIL.\\n5. The Court should be fully satisfied that substantial public\\ninterest is involved before entertaining the petition.\\n6. The Court should ensure that the petition which involves\\nlarger public interest, gravity and urgency must be given\\npriority over other petitions.'),\n",

He is appointed by the president by warrant under his hand and\\nseal. In a way, he is a nominee of the Central government. But, as held by\\nthe Supreme Court in 1979, the office of governor of a state is not an\\nemployment under the Central government. It is an independent\\nconstitutional office and is not under the control of or subordinate to the\\nCentral government.\\nThe Draft Constitution provided for the direct election of the governor\\non the basis of universal adult suffrage. But the Constituent Assembly\\nopted for the present system of appointment of governor by the president\\nbecause of the following reasons1 :\\n1.The direct election of the governor is incompatible with the\\nparliamentary system established in the states.\\n2.The mode of direct election is more likely to create conflicts between\\nthe governor and the chief minister.\\n3.The governor being only a constitutional (nominal) head, there is no\\npoint in making elaborate arrangements for his election and\\nspending huge amount of money.\\n4.The election of a governor would be entirely on personal issues.\\nHence, it is not in the national interest to involve a large number of\\nvoters in such an election.\\n5.An elected governor would naturally belong to a party and would not\\nbe a neutral person and an impartial head.\\n6.The election of governor would create separatist tendencies and\\nthus affect the political stability and unity of the country.\\n7.The system of presidential nomination enables the Centre to\\nmaintain its control over the states.\\n8.The direct election of the governor creates a serious problem of\\nleadership at the time of a general election in the state.\\n9.The chief minister would like his nominee to contest for\\ngovernorship. Hence, a second rate man of the ruling party is\\nelected as governor.\\nTherefore, the American model, where the Governor of a state is\\ndirectly elected, was dropped and the Canadian model, where the\\ngovernor of a province (state) is appointed by the Governor-General\\n(Centre), was accepted in the Constituent Assembly.\\nThe Constitution lays down only two qualifications for the appointment\\nof a person as a governor. These are:\\n1.He should be a citizen of India.'),\n",

Article 164 only says\\nthat the Chief Minister shall be appointed by the governor. However,\\nthis does not imply that the governor is free to appoint any one as\\nthe Chief Minister. In accordance with the conventions of the\\nparliamentary system of government, the governor has to appoint\\nthe leader of the majority party in the state legislative assembly as\\nthe Chief Minister. But, when no party has a clear majority in the\\nassembly, then the governor may exercise his personal discretion in\\nthe selection and appointment of the Chief Minister. In such a\\nsituation, the governor usually appoints the leader of the largest\\nparty or coalition in the assembly as the Chief Minister and ask him\\nto seek a vote of confidence in the House within a month.1\\nThe governor may have to exercise his individual judgement in\\nthe selection and appointed of the Chief Minister when the Chief\\nMinister in office dies suddenly and there is no obvious successor.\\nHowever, on the death of a Chief Minister, the ruling party usually\\nelects a new leader and the governor has no choice but to appoint\\nhim as Chief Minister.\\nThe Constitution does not require that a person must prove his\\nmajority in the legislative assembly before he is appointed as the\\nChief Minister. The governor may first appoint him as the Chief\\nMinister and then ask him to prove his majority in the legislative\\nassembly within a reasonable period. This is what has been done in\\na number of cases2 .\\nA person who is not a member of the state legislature can be\\nappointed as Chief Minister for six months, within which time, he\\nshould be elected to the state legislature, failing which he ceases to\\nbe the Chief Minister.3\\nAccording to the Constitution, the Chief Minister may be a\\nmember of any of the two Houses of a state legislature. Usually\\nChief Ministers have been selected from the Lower House\\n(legislative assembly), but, on a number of occasions, a member of\\nthe Upper House (legislative council) has also been appointed as\\nChief Minister.4'),\n",

Most of\\nthe states have an unicameral system, while others have a bicameral\\nsystem. At present (2019), only six states have two Houses\\n(bicameral). These are Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh,\\nBihar, Maharashtra and Karnataka. The Jammu and Kashmir\\nLegislative Council was abolishes by the Jammu and Kashmir\\nReorganisation Act, 2019.1 The Tamil Nadu Legislative Council Act,\\n2010 has not come into force. The Legislative Council in Andhra\\nPradesh was revived by the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council Act,\\n2005. The 7th Amendment Act of 1956 provided for a Legislative\\nCouncil in Madhya Pradesh. However, a notification to this effect has\\nto be made by the President. So far, no such notification has been\\nmade. Hence, Madhya Pradesh continues to have one House only.\\nThe twenty-two states have unicameral system. Here, the state\\nlegislature consists of the governor and the legislative assembly. In\\nthe states having bicameral system, the state legislature consists of\\nthe governor, the legislative council and the legislative assembly. The\\nlegislative council (Vidhan Parishad) is the upper house (second\\nchamber or house of elders), while the legislative assembly (Vidhan\\nSabha) is the lower house (first chamber or popular house).\\nThe Constitution provides for the abolition or creation of legislative\\ncouncils in states. Accordingly, the Parliament can abolish a legislative\\ncouncil (where it already exists) or create it (where it does not exist), if\\nthe legislative assembly of the concerned state passes a resolution to\\nthat effect. Such a specific resolution must be passed by the state\\nassembly by a special majority, that is, a majority of the total\\nmembership of the assembly and a majority of not less than two-thirds\\nof the members of the assembly present and voting. This Act of\\nParliament is not to be deemed as an amendment of the Constitution\\nfor the purposes of Article 368 and is passed like an ordinary piece of\\nlegislation (ie, by simple majority).\\n“The idea of having a second chamber in the states was criticised\\nin the Constituent Assembly on the ground that it was not\\nrepresentative of the people, that it delayed legislative process and\\nthat it was an expensive institution2 .” Consequently the provision was\\nmade for the abolition or creation of a legislative council to enable a\\nstate to have a second chamber or not according to its own'),\n",

It enabled the unpopular, rejected\\nand ambitious politicians to occupy the post of a chief minister or a\\nminister or a member of the state legislature.\\nEven though the council has been given less powers as compared\\nwith the assembly, its utility is supported on the following grounds:\\n1.It checks the hasty, defective, careless and ill-considered\\nlegislation made by the assembly by making provision for\\nrevision and thought.\\n2.It facilitates representation of eminent professionals and experts\\nwho cannot face direct elections. The governor nominates one-\\nsixth members of the council to provide representation to such\\npeople.'),\n",

The judiciary ina state consists of a high court and a\\nhierarchy of subordinate courts. The high court occupies the top\\nposition in the judicial administration of a state.\\nThe institution of high court originated in India in 1862 when the\\nhigh courts were set up at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras1. In\\n1866, a fourth high court was established at Allahabad. In the\\ncourse of time, each province in British India came to have its own\\nhigh court. After 1950, a high court existing in a province became\\nthe high court for the corresponding state.\\nThe Constitution of India provides for a high court for each\\nstate, but the Seventh Amendment Act of 1956 authorised the\\nParliament to establish a common high court for two or more\\nstates or for two or more states and a union territory. The territorial\\njurisdiction of a high court is co-terminus with the territory of a\\nstate. Similarly, the territorial jurisdiction of a common high court is\\nco-terminus with the territories of the concerned states and union\\nterritory.\\nAt present (2019), there are 25 high courts in the country2. Out\\nof them, only three high courts have jurisdiction over more than\\none state. Among the nine union territories, Delhi alone has a\\nseparate high court (since 1966). The union territories of Jammu\\nand Kashmir and Ladakh have a common high court. The other\\nunion territories fall under the jurisdiction of different state high\\ncourts.

Thus, the Constitution does\\nnot specify the strength of a high court and leaves it to the\\ndiscretion of the president. Accordingly, the President determines\\nthe strength of a high court from time to time depending upon its\\nworkload.\\nAppointment of Judges\\nThe judges of a high court are appointed by the President. The\\nchief justice is appointed by the President after consultation with\\nthe chief justice of India and the governor of the state concerned.\\nFor appointment of other judges, the chief justice of the concerned\\nhigh court is also consulted. In case of a common high court for\\ntwo or more states, the governors of all the states concerned are\\nconsulted by the president.\\nIn the Second Judges case3 (1993), the Supreme Court ruled\\nthat no appointment of a judge of the high court can be made,\\nunless it is in conformity with the opinion of the chief justice of\\nIndia. In the Third Judges case4 (1998), the Supreme Court\\nopined that in case of the appointment of high court judges, the\\nchief justice of India should consult a collegium of two senior-most\\njudges of the Supreme Court. Thus, the sole opinion of the chief\\njustice of India alone does not constitute the ‘consultation’\\nprocess.\\nThe 99th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2014 and the\\nNational Judicial Appointments Commission Act of 2014 have\\nreplaced the Collegium System of appointing judges to the\\nSupreme Court and High Courts with a new body called the\\nNational Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC). However, in\\n2015, the Supreme Court has declared both the 99th\\nConstitutional Amendment as well as the NJAC Act as\\nunconstitutional and void.

This phenomena of bureaucratisation of\\ndevelopment administration as against the democratisation weakened\\nthe Panchayati Raj institutions resulting in what is aptly called as\\n‘grass without roots’. Hence, the Committee made the following\\nrecommendations to strengthen and revitalise the Panchayati Raj\\nsystem:\\n(i)The district level body, that is, the Zila Parishad should be of\\npivotal importance in the scheme of democratic decentralisation.\\nIt stated that “the district is the proper unit for planning and\\ndevelopment and the Zila Parishad should become the principal\\nbody for management of all development programmes which can\\nbe handled at that level.”\\n(ii)The Panchayati Raj institutions at the district and lower levels\\nshould be assigned an important role with respect to planning,\\nimplementation and monitoring of rural development programmes.\\n(iii)Some of the planning functions at the state level should be\\ntransferred to the district level planning units for effective\\ndecentralized district planning.\\n(iv)A post of District Development Commissioner should be created.\\nHe should act as the chief executive officer of the Zila Parishad\\nand should be in charge of all the development departments at\\nthe district level.\\n(v)Elections to the Panchayati Raj institutions should be held\\nregularly. It found that elections became overdue for one or more\\ntiers in 11 states.\\nThus the committee, in its scheme of decentralised system of field\\nadministration, assigned a leading role to the Panchayati Raj in local\\nplanning and development.

In general, Panchayats in our country\\nreceive funds in the following ways:\\n(i)Grants from the Union Government based on \\nrecommendations of the Central Finance Commission as \\nArticle 280 of the Constitution.\\n(ii)Devolution from the State Government based on \\nrecommendations of the State Finance Commission as per Art\\n243-I.\\n(iii)Loans / grants from the State Government.\\n(iv)Programme-specific allocation under Centrally Sponso\\nSchemes and Additional Central Assistance.\\n(v)Internal Resource Generation (tax and non-tax).\\n2.Across the country, States have not given adequate attention to\\nfiscal empowerment of the Panchayats. The Panchayats own\\nresources are meager. Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are\\nthe states which are considered to be progressive in PRIs\\nempowerment but even there, the Panchayats are heavily\\ndependent on government grants. One can draw the following\\nbroad conclusions:\\n(i)Internal resource generation at the Panchayat level is weak. T\\nis partly due to a thin tax domain and partly due to Panchay\\nown reluctance in collecting revenue.\\n(ii)Panchayats are heavily dependent on grants from Union \\nState Governments.\\n(iii)A major portion of the grants both from Union as well as the S\\nGovernments is scheme specific. Panchayats have lim\\ndiscretion and flexibility in incurring expenditure.\\n(iv)In view of their own tight fiscal position, State Governments \\nnot keen to devolve funds to Panchayats.\\n(v)In most of the critical Eleventh Schedule matters like prim'),\n",

The various reasons for this sub-optimal performance\\nare as follows7b:\\n1.Lack of adequate devolution: Many States have not taken\\nadequate steps to devolve 3Fs (i.e., functions, funds and\\nfunctionaries) to the PRIs to enable them to discharge their\\nconstitutionally stipulated function. Further, it is imperative that\\nthe PRIs have resources to match the responsibilities entrusted\\nto them. While SFCs (state finance commissions) have\\nsubmitted their recommendations, not many few States have\\nimplemented these or taken steps to ensure the fiscal viability of\\nthe PRIs.\\n2.Excessive control by bureaucracy: In some States, the Gram\\nPanchayats have been placed in a position of subordination.\\nHence, the Gram Panchayat Sarpanches have to spend\\nextraordinary amount of time visiting Block Offices for funds\\nand/or technical approval. These interactions with the Block staff\\noffice distort the role of Sarpanches as elected representatives.\\n3.Tied nature of funds: This has two implications. The activities\\nstated under a certain scheme are not always appropriate for all\\nparts of the district. This results in unsuitable activities being\\npromoted or an under-spend of the funds.\\n4.Overwhelming dependency on government funding: A\\nreview of money received and own source funds shows the\\noverwhelming dependence of Panchayats on government\\nfunding. When Panchayats do not raise resources and instead\\nreceive funds from outside, people are less likely to request a\\nsocial audit.\\n5.Reluctance to use fiscal powers: An important power\\ndevolved to GP (Gram Panchayat) is the right to levy tax on\\nproperty, business, markets, fairs and also for services provided,\\nlike street lighting or public toilets, etc. Very few Panchayats use\\ntheir fiscal power to levy and collect taxes. The argument\\npushed by Panchayat heads is that it is difficult to levy tax on'),\n",

But,\\nthe laws of Parliament prevail over those made by the Assembly.\\nThe strength of the council of ministers is fixed at ten per cent\\nof the total strength of the assembly, that is, seven–one chief\\nminister and six other ministers. The chief minister is appointed by\\nthe President (not by the lt. governor). The other ministers are\\nappointed by the president on the advice of the chief minister. The\\nministers hold office during the pleasure of the president. The\\ncouncil of ministers is collectively responsible to the assembly.\\nThe council of ministers headed by the chief minister aid and\\nadvise the lt. governor in the exercise of his functions except in so\\nfar as he is required to act in his discretion. In the case of\\ndifference of opinion between the lt. governor and his ministers,\\nthe lt. governor is to refer the matter to the president for decision\\nand act accordingly.\\nWhen a situation arises in which the administration of the\\nterritory cannot be carried on in accordance with the above\\nprovisions, the president can suspend their (above provisions)\\noperation and make the necessary incidental or consequential\\nprovisions for administering the territory. In brief, in case of failure\\nof constitutional machinery, the president can impose his rule in\\nthe territory. This can be done on the report of the lt. governor or\\notherwise. This provision resembles Article 356 which deals with\\nthe imposition of President’s Rule in the states.'),\n",

These matters\\nare handled by the Department of Personnel and Training–one of the\\nthree departments of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances\\nand Pensions5. Therefore, UPSC is only a central recruiting agency\\nwhile the Department of Personnel and Training is the central\\npersonnel agency in India.\\nThe role of UPSC is not only limited, but also recommendations\\nmade by it are only of advisory nature and hence, not binding on the\\ngovernment. It is upto the Union government to accept or reject that\\nadvise. The only safeguard is the answerability of the government to\\nthe Parliament for departing from the recommendation of the\\nCommission.

The\\naccountability of the executive (i.e., council of ministers) to the\\nParliament in the sphere of financial administration is secured\\nthrough audit reports of the CAG. The CAG is an agent of the\\nParliament and conducts audit of expenditure on behalf of the\\nParliament. Therefore, he is responsible only to the Parliament.\\nThe CAG has more freedom with regard to audit of expenditure\\nthan with regard to audit of receipts, stores and stock. “Whereas\\nin relation to expenditure he decides the scope of audit and\\nframes his own audit codes and manuals, he has to proceed with\\nthe approval of the executive government in relation to rules for\\nthe conduct of the other audits.”3a\\nThe CAG has ‘to ascertain whether money shown in the\\naccounts as having been disbursed was legally available for and\\napplicable to the service or the purpose to which they have been\\napplied or charged and whether the expenditure conforms to the\\nauthority that governs it’. In addition to this legal and regulatory\\naudit, the CAG can also conduct the propriety audit, that is, he\\ncan look into the ‘wisdom, faithfulness and economy’ of\\ngovernment expenditure and comment on the wastefulness and\\nextravagance of such expenditure. However, unlike the legal and\\nregulatory audit, which is obligatory on the part of the CAG, the\\npropriety audit is discretionary.\\nThe secret service expenditure is a limitation on the auditing\\nrole of the CAG. In this regard, the CAG cannot call for particulars\\nof expenditure incurred by the executive agencies, but has to\\naccept a certificate from the competent administrative authority\\nthat the expenditure has been so incurred under his authority.\\nThe Constitution of India visualises the CAG to be Comptroller\\nas well as Auditor General. However, in practice, the CAG is\\nfulfilling the role of an Auditor-General only and not that of a\\nComptroller. In other words, ‘the CAG has no control over the\\nissue of money from the consolidated fund and many departments\\nare authorised to draw money by issuing cheques without specific'),\n",

The CAG is today a primary cause of widespread and\\nparalysing unwillingness to decide and to act. Auditing has a\\nrepressive and negative influence.\\n3.

India is a diversified country and its\\nstates are in various phases of economic development along with\\ntheir own strengths and weaknesses. In this context, a ‘one-size-fits-\\nall’ approach to economic planning is obsolete.
